Rumors that are being spread, in order to
intimidate us, they will be able to renew them
in St Pierre itself, but let us not
allow ourselves to be Surprised by the Traps
that will be set for us, and let us have
only our Duty before our Eyes,
and our Citizen's Oath in
our Heart.

If, as we dare to
flatter ourselves, the Success of the day responds
to your Expectation, let no indiscreet
Exclamation escape us, let us withdraw
quietly and in Silence.
This Mark of Moderation will
bring us as much Honor, as a
Reproach that we do not deserve,
has been able to indignate us.
