a similar Arrangement; the King and the
Ministers believed that to restore it in nothing,
they have indeed the Peers to break their
chains which put Hindrances to their
Views, in order to restore them. They then quite
tranquilly let die the King who had
subjugated all the Provinces. There were no longer
any of the Malcontents and Frondeurs,
but it is the small Number, the Chancellor
will always do all that he wishes, but
time is needed, as much to calm the
agitated Spirits, as to prepare the
business.

Princes have always absolutes of the Court,
each that the faults, no Point of Etiquette,
alone awaits them in the Party they have
embraced.

The Parliament of Paris will
contract itself, they still receive there, and very soon this
Parliament will be elder of the Royals, the Nation
is under said to those who opposed it, then
that one must forget all the disagreement.

The Superior Councils will equally
be good, with the Reserve of some Bailiwicks,
which are embittered or which are so for a
nothing; to which the Commerce which is done for
the Palace one perceives, that it suffices hours
which reigns, that has pity of the good to live.
If one has haste nothing.
