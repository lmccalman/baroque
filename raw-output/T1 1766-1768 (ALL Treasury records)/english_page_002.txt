Sir

In obedience to the orders which I have
received from the Right Honorable the the
Earl of Rockford, I have the honour to
inform you, that since the Earl's late more
Skips, Exclusive of those that carry the
Roman Catholics, have gone from hence to
the Continent of North America, than
there did formerly.

which I am, by the Right Honorable Earl ordered
to give you, I can lay nothing of the real

which sailed from hence to the St. Eustatius,
namely,

Skelton, E. Andrew, Thomas Boesson, for Bryg Brien
