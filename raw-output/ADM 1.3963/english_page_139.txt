Changes in the current ecclesiastical
Departments.

Mr de Plivelier, President at
the Grand Council, has just been made
First President of this tribunal,
in the Place of Mr de la Bourdonneye,
who has left.

Mr le Noir, Controller of State, has
represented today in General Ceremony
of Police, which is taken from
Mr Hebert. The King has promised to Mr
Hebert the first Place of Intendant
of Province which will become vacant,
and in the meantime he enjoys
18 thousand Livres of Pension.

One sees nothing from the part
of the New Minister of Finance,
and the Changes make the same R.D.
