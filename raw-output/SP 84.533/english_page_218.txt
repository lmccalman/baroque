Several Members of the former
Parliament of Paris have already received the
reimbursements of the price of their
Offices, on that side everything has settled
in Paris, may it not be so elsewhere.

The Duke of Duras received last Monday
in Paris, where he is detained for
the [quête], a Letter from the King, similar
to that of the Prince of Beauveau. Their
Majesties declare to him, that being of the
Number of Peers who have protested,
he can no longer [le devouer de leur voir]
the brave men with whom they find
themselves, as much the enemy within;
it is the Duke of Fitz-James who replaces him.

The Duke d'Aiguillon would like to place there
the Marshal de Broglie, but the Chancellor
who no longer has [qui]. Besides, one has [empoisrté]
for Milord Fitz James, the latter
will depart this Week to go in effect
the Parliament of Rennes, and to bring back
another before the Coming of the States
of the Province, one foresees that this
assembly of the States will be stormy.
[S'il] that perhaps it will be the last,
which [forrait] in effect, but one would not
[informeroit] them to the Intentions
of the King.
