                        Genoa the 21st November 1776.

                                    We have in
our Port two [Bâtiques], built
in Venice, one with a Capacity of 4 Thousand,
the other of 2 Thousand Pounds Bales,
and a Tartane of One Thousand Quintals.
The two [Bâtiques] have been chartered,
one to go for 94 Thousand of
[Carmes], and the other has already departed
for Alexandria, having been
purchased by a Merchant
of that Country. The Tartane
belongs to a Merchant
from here.

        Last year in Genoa there was
another tartane with a Capacity
of 1800 Pounds Bales, which was
purchased by a Frenchman.

        A [Bâtique] is currently being built
in our [Alpicol],
                                                    and
