the King communicated to him News about
Dantzick, and the [Patrouans] of this neighborhood
Ministry have reported that it was going to occur there.
       Mr. de la Bouse First General, is
dead; the King has not appointed a Successor,
so that these are the First Officers
of a Reduction of 20 First Generals,
that the Minister of War will compose,
and also that of no longer having henceforth the Funds
of each First General; it is certain
that from this Reduction being made, there will
be gained 2 Million 400 Thousand Livres
per Year for the King, and 6 Objects in
this are well the Part.
       As the Minister with his Suggestions is so
occupied, they will determine
alternately each General Receipt
and each Receiver of Tailles:
there will be only one General Receiver
per Generality, and one Receiver of
Tailles per Election.
       There was the day before yesterday a dreadful
Revolt in the House of detention of
Bicêtres, because of the Misery which
reigns there, they transferred a Part of the
People to this neighboring Palace, where there were
up to 800 Persons, who finally
calmed the [trou mage].
