310

Houses of the Town have been overturned;
the Number who perished there is not yet known
   The Persons of this earthquake. The
Earth were two Hours almost Without
Calming down; during this time we saw
arrive and Disappear, Without being able to Save
anyone, nor save anything. All the Effects
were buried Under the Ruins of the Houses
the [Scelests] could not Save their Arms
the General, the Intendant and the Troops all
occupied all the [Tentres] On the Square.
   There: the earth still trembles there. One
presumes that the Explosion took place there, or
very near, for the first Shock made
itself Felt at 7 o'clock at Port au Prince,
and this Only at 7¼ o'clock, and it was
observed that the Movements of the Earth
were from West to east.
