                                                    I am going to change today
in the Ambassadors all that the Duke of
Choiseul had announced with M. Duguay,
the Baron de Breteuil, of whom some speak
and who will deliver M. d'Aubeton, the Duke
de St Aignan will replace the Baron de
Breteuil, and M. the duke Vauguyon M.
d'Aubeton. I think that you continue,
some the Ambassadors named
by this good Minister, there is the hour
recalled, one owes that of Naples and
of Turin; who owes the Princes &c. the
King; moreover the Parliament & even
