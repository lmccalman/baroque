Private Letter

                    Paris the 25th November 1775.

                                        The patriotic
writers do not allow themselves to be
[user] responding with pamphlets in favor
of the Cause which they defended; they do
not fear to repeat the great
Principles recorded in so many Works
On the natural Liberty of Man,
On the Inviolability of His Rights,
On the Origin of Laws, On the [Centrale
Sonnable]...; They maintain that what
will not be freely acted explained
in one pamphlet, is better developed
in another: It is without doubt
for this Reason, that an Anonymous
has just made a Response to the
three Articles of the Edict registered
at the lit de Justice of 12 December 1770.
These three Articles are:

We hold our Crown
only from God.
