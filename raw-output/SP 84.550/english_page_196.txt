Madrid the 30. April. 1778.

                                I am informed from
Malaga dated the 30th of the Current,
that the Kings L... & Cabeccha, of which
I spoke in my previous,
had set sail the previous day,
to go cover our [Baffices]
of Africa, & cruise against
the Barbary pirates.
      Dated the 10th Current, they
write to me from Cartagena, that they
had launched into the water there, the Galley
Frigate, which had been constructed there
on the Model of that which had been
given by Don George Juan,
and that it was believed that its First
Voyage would be to the Philippines,
to go transport there
Munitions and Artillery.
      Two Warships of
70. Cannons, had arrived there from
                                Naples,
