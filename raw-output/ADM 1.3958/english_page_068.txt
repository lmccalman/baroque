State and Finance Councillor of Vendome,
even that he would have particularly announced
that prompt aid of
funds will be sent to Princes and Peoples:
giving as the Motive for this
News, that the First President
of the Parliament of Paris having been unable
to succeed in directly rendering
to His Majesty that with which the Company
charged him, and that having to fear
that because of the distance
their Representations would not have
the same Fate, the Course of making them
reach the King by more than one
route, appeared to them the surest.

This Decree is a true witness
against the Execution of the New
Code, which reduces the Parlements
to Sovereign Councils, Subordinate
to the Parliament of France, Sole
one held in Paris, and which also held
the Court of Peers.

The [plénations] of Messieurs
the Duke and peer of France of Paris, and of
France, do not stop.
