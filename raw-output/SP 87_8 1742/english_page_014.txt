recognition of my wrongs, my sincere 
confessions, my docility, my submission my attentiveness
my tender cares, have been able to reassure her and 
restore to her a part of her tranquility. I feel 
that she cannot have the strength to break off 
forever. She still loves me and she has not 
had the courage to sacrifice me. The letter that she 
wrote to me yesterday has given me new 
hopes, and if she can yield to my entreaties, 
I will resume tomorrow with her a new course 
of happiness. O thou who knowest my weaknesses and 
my transgressions, who knowest the purity of my 
heart and the vivacity of my sentiments, grant 
me the grace to stray no more, and to 
conduct myself with more wisdom and prudence 
in so delicate a situation. Give me 
the strength to resist the impetuous movements 
of my passions, and to submit all my desires 
to reason and to virtue. Make it so that I know how to 
merit by my wise and circumspect conduct 
the esteem and the confidence of her whom I adore, 
and that I may render her happy, by giving her 
all the proofs of a sincere attachment 
and of an unalterable tenderness. I feel 
how much it matters to me to correct myself of my 
faults, and to render myself worthy of possessing 
so precious a blessing. I wish henceforth 
to be more master of myself, and to submit 
all my movements to reason and to 
reflection. I feel that it is the only means 
of meriting the esteem and the confidence of my 
friend, and of tasting with her a happiness 
pure and lasting.
