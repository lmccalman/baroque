It is written from Mallorca, and from
Mahon, that work continues there without
cease, to prevent all Misfortune
in a second Expedition against
Algiers; to be shortly under the
Orders of Mr. Barcello: in case
this Barbaresque Regency
does not accept the Conditions
of the King.

It is assured that the Count
d'Aranda, will return to Paris
after his Marriage with his
Niece, Daughter of the Duke of Hyart
and that from there, he will go to Vienna,
to execute there a Commission
of the King.

The evening before last arrived
here the Duke of Crillon returning
from France.
