Rotterdam 5e March 1775.

My Lord

I had the Honour to transmit to your
Lordship the 23d of last Month a Letter from
M. Holroyd of Paris, together with the Copy of
the Letter of which the ORIGINAL has been
communicated to Comte of Lauraguais.

In consequence of that Letter, Comte Lauraguais has
remained in Amiens these 10 or 12 thousand
Livres, where upon Condition that I would satisfy
him that he is back of being able to have a roll,
as his Brother is immediately going into the
War Office, and to whom he has solicited his
application; I assured him of all the
Intelligence that shall enable him to form some
Scheme whereupon (Referring us to Mons l'Comte)
of this time truly, he demands only L12 Sterling
for his Letter in relation that the ORIGINAL
shall be suppressed if we will put him in
Possession of his Services, and in the
recompensed for any such or ordinary
Services as he shall render to England.
The above Character shows that the L12 Sterling may
be advanced him.

I tell this Mr. Holroyd agreeably your Lordships
commands.

I have the Honour to be most Respectfully.

My Lord        Your Lordships
                most Obedient and
His Excellency              most Humble Servant,
the Earl of Halifax.        J.D. Hake.
