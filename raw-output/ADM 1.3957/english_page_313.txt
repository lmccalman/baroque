Brussels, April 13, 1770.

I informed you that
the President of France had solicited
Permission for the Purchase and Exportation
of Grains. The Prince of Starhemberg
has just had this Permission prohibited
until the Grain Revolt is
finished; Prohibition to the Merchants
who had committed themselves to furnish these
Grains to the said President, with an Order
to bring to the public Markets
all the Grains that they have purchased, under
penalty of Confiscation. This Affair
could well cause us a small
Quarrel with the Court of France.
