Misfortunes, occasioned by an
affected Campaign that we experienced
Monday 21st.

Letters from Cæcilia said, that there are
Orders given in all the Ports
of the Monarchy, to equip promptly
some vessels of War, and that the
Officers and Blues of the Marines have
Orders, to report to their respective
Posts.     As these Letters
announce no Motive for such
an Armament, it is necessary to
await Confirmation of it.
