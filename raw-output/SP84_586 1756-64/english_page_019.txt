I do not know if I find in this
habit a good for myself or if
it causes me harm. I see that
I would wish not to have
these intervals of lucidity which
make me witness to my state and which
make me feel all the weight of my
misery. I would wish to be able
to abandon myself entirely to my delirium
and to not have these moments of
reason which make me see all
the horror of my situation. I find
in these intervals a kind of
death which is unbearable to me and
which makes me desire to fall back
into my bewilderment. But I do not
know if this desire does not come from the
weakness of my mind which cannot
bear the sight of its state and which
seeks to escape from it by all the
means that are in its power.
