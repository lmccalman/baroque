Rotterdam the 12th March 1771


Milord

By the Letter that You did me the honor
of writing to me the 19th March, I learn the agreeable
news, that it pleased His Majesty to grant me
very graciously the Continuation of the Secret
Correspondences, with the Gratification of £St. 30. per quarter
which my late Husband enjoyed, and the £St. 5. per quarter
in addition, for my postal expenses.
Receive Milord my very humble thanks,
for the support that You were pleased to give me to
make this matter succeed, I will preserve for it all
my Life the most lively gratitude, and I will
prove it with my attention; you can be
my Zeal in the Handling of the Correspondences,
Nor the Hopes that the P.de S.te
Pierre gives us of His Know-how, by the Means and
the Channel of His brother, and that His Demands
are not Unreasonable for a man
of wit. You do me too much honor As
You give me Permission

I have the honor to be very Respectfully
                                     Milord

                                     Your very humble and
                                     very Obedient Servant
                                     M.e Wolters.
