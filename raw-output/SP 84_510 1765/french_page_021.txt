                                    Rotterdam the 8th October 1763

My Lord Duke

                I think it is my Duty to transmit
to Your Grace the inclosed project of our
Rotterdam Gazette of last Tuesday, as it
contains Matters which were made a Noise
in this Country, & which Circumstances
may perhaps hereafter prompt to endeavour to
be contradicted in a publick Manner
if it should prove to be false, or
misrepresented, or to shew some
Attention to this Instance if the Facts
upon Inquiry prove to be true.
                I have made all possible Enquiry
about the Dutch East India Company's Catherine,
which is possibly due, and find that
the Inclosed Certificate is gone to
Gottland for a freight.
                I have had the Perusal of the Dutch
chapter's Letter, which says little more
of the Fact than the Gazette, excepting
that he names the Quantities of things
that were taken from him: viz: 4 hoggs
of Liquor, 2 Pounds of Tea, and Loaf
of Coff, besides their Provisions, being
all Ships Stores.
