N°. 27.

                    Paris the 29th March 1776.

                    Our Letters from Brest
announce nothing more than what
has been said.
     Those from Toulon of the 23rd say the
[Promenement] advanced, but the
Sardine, which is handling the matter, is
still at Sea; it is awaited; it
will delay the Departure.
     The [Combe] of St Germain, although
little favored, is very official, it does
not want by People. Its great
work only appears from the 20th to the
28th April in Paris; time, at which
all the Regiments are on the March,
of their State, in order to avoid the
[Contentés] and the Solicitations.
     The Provincial Commanders
have no Order yet to
depart; the Colonels, are in bad
                                        Humor.
