R 5 Oust

Paris the 28th July 1782

Two [Echavises] have been joined
to the Fabrics destined for Toulon,
and it was carried at the same time to
search for Four [Cabannes] which carry
as well as the Fabrics, [Pagnes],
Equipment, &c. for the Squadron of the
Mediterranean. The Fabrics have on board
principally Guinea or false Guinea
from Towns, and the Materials from la Guienne,
and from the Triomphant.

We learn that l'Orient
and [Neidemeni] are Free, and that
even all the Vessels coming from
the Indies, will only be able to unload
in this Port. So many Favors
will make l'Orient in a short time a very
considerable City, and very rich by
the Quantity of Americans who will
come to land there, and this Leaving
from the Province of Brittany, will
very quickly be viniferous.
