                 The feast of the Lectins at nine o'clock in the Evening
                        in a Hall.

08              We will continue to put our
                Buildings in Order in time; but one fears
                that Wood may be lacking.

19              Workers are arriving to us from
                all Parts; this is what makes made our

                The Retirements proceed as usual.
                There are still many who
                are growing weak.
