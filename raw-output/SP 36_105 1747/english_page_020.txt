N°9. those relating to James Carnegy alias-
Alexander Taylor.-
There are in each packet transcriptions-
of the more material papers, excepting of those
which I have already sent translations of.
As to the tryals at full length it was thought
needless to translate them; as the more-
material points of them have every pen-
been transmitted by me.-
In every packet is a list of the contents
of the packet.-
