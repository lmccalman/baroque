Basel the 30th September 1781.

The Bandits continue
always to make Raids, they have
[ulant] good children of the Isle and of Elles
who do much Ravage, and then
they would re-embark, they [viens
d'entres], they set fire to more
than 20 Thousand Planks, which were
destined for the Barracks, this
Loss is evaluated at one hundred Thousand écus, they
set fire to a very beautiful Bark
in the Isle of one [qui poï] a very
beautiful Ship loaded with Munitions
of the Navy. The great Road
from here to Corte is hardly safe;
it is magnificent; this has already
diminished the Provisions, which the Transports
increased much, one could only
do it on the Back of Mules.
