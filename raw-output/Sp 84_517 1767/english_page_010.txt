Rotterdam den 18 1765.


Sir -


I have the honour to send you enclosed a
new list of the Spanish Navy brought down
to the 1st of October last past. My Correspondent
assures me that it is correct in all its parts.
I am in hopes that before the end of the year
I shall be able also to compleat a new list
of the French Navy.

I have the honour to be most respectfully,

Sir

                                        your most humble
                                        and most obedient Serv[an]t
                                        R.Wilson.
