        We have learned
of the arrival of an Officer at Court,
dispatched by Mr. Barolle, then Lieutenant
Major: Since then we have been informed
by the Letters from St Télèphonnes,
of the Arrival of Mr. Barolle at
Cartagena, where he entered on the 11th of the
Current month, with all his Convoy,
with the exception of a vessel of the
Line, a Tarquain, and a Galley
taken to watch for the Movements
and the Behavior of the Algerians,
having been obliged to leave the Bay
of Algiers by the heavy Weather after
Nine Days of Bombardment,
and after having set fire to and ruined
the City, and destroyed the Navy of
these Pirates. This Expedition
cost us, it is said, 24 Men both Dead
and wounded.
