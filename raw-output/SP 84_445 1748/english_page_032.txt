My Lord Duke,

By the Prince of Orange's being now
authorized by the States of Holland to this once
to make in the Magistracy of all the voting
cities of the Province such changes as he
shall think necessary, it is expected that his
Prince Highness will do far gratify the
expectations of the People as to remove such
Magistrates in each City as were most obnoxious.
At Haerlem there are three parties, one
for the old Magistracy, a second for the remaining
all the Points that the Burgers of Amsterdam
have obtained, and the last which is more
moderate and moderate in its demands.
The Burgers of Leyden have drawn up

Duke of Bedford.                196
