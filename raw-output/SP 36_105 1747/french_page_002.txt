Mylord -

I have last night been to Covington the-
napages who is to band the inhabitants with
the Governors free passport, he was very de-
sireous for your Lordship, undertaking all the
Papers about the Tryal of the Prisoners and
the declaration that Sir Williem Benson
gave to the Peace of Orange in original. -
as we have no copy of this declaration here
and that there was none to to take one, he proposes
that your Lordship should sign the original by
when he has copy returned to me and he
rushes Brydon having the Peace of Orange Orders
to make an copy of the whole.
    Inclose your Lordship will find the declaration
of my Journal of the Tryal of the Prisoners I hope
that the Messieurs that will be with it then will
be with the next with which I shall give your Lordship
an affair which my Duty and Zeal rendres probably
had me to take much at heart -
    I suppose that the Royal Highness the Duke
has been by your Lordship informed of my transactions
