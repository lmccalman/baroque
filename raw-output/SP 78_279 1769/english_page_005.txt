Friendship        November 1768
N° 4

Sir my dear friend, I send you herewith my
Balance Sheet, and beg you to be so kind as to place it before the eyes of
the Directors gentlemen, you know better than anyone what I
am worth and my circumstances, I beg you to tell them what
you know of them, you will also tell them I beg you that I am
quite ready to make to them any other declaration that they judge
proper to ask of me, I flatter myself that they will be so kind as to grant
me grace for this bill which is for one hundred fifty four thousand livres namely
154000#. I beg you also my dear friend to arrange that
the Directors gentlemen be well persuaded that I would not ask
them for this grace if I were in a state to do without it, I promise you well
that I will remember it all my life, and that I will do all that
will depend on me to acknowledge your kindness, and I beg you to
believe that no one is with more gratitude and attachment
than me.
