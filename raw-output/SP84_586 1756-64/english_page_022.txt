she the acquaintances of Gauthier-Rayn.
The captain of the merchant ship who had set sail
for Europe under the name of the Herminie; as my
father told me, delivered to me a case in which were found
papers that I am curious to see. As half
of the day had passed I postponed until the next day
doing this review and reading the letter attached to this
delivery. On the 9th of the month, from the morning, I set
about satisfying my curiosity. I began
by breaking the seals of the letter. I do not give
here the copy of it, but I will extract from it what could
interest the friend of my young Indian woman. My father
informed me of a small inheritance coming from
my aunt and which consisted of some effects and
jewelry that formerly she had worn. She gave
me these details with the kindness that was
natural to her. This letter still contained a
kind of memorandum which informed me what each
box contained.
