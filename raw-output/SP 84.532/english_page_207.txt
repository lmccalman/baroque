Rotterdam the 22 February 1711


My Lord

It is with the most Lively Sorrow that I announce to You
the sad News of the death of my dear
and well beloved Spouse who died Suddenly when
last in an attack of apoplexy occurred in
the honor of some friends the very day My Lord
but the frightful overwhelm where throws me a Blow so
crushing, obliges me to employ other hands than
mine, after which You judge well that in this
condition and in a moment full of so much with all
and Painful Circumstance where I find myself

I take the liberty My Lord to recommend myself and my
two daughters in Your high Protection and
Pray You to be willing to remember us in the
Continuation of the Secret Correspondences, which Given
their utility I flatter myself Will be Continued, and that
I may enjoy the gratuitous gratification to
Conduct to His Excellence even the Composition of the
pieces, and the Services that he rendered, as well as the
small Salary of our Common Monsieur Thales,
whom I take the liberty to recommend in
particular to Your Excellence: he is my Husband
[aiment] and [éthernent] [Epouvré], and of whom he spoke
well on different Occasions and whom he even
recommended to His high Protectors and Powerful friends,
I Pray You My Lord that he be rendered worthy
by His Zeal, His fidelity, and His Activity, in all
