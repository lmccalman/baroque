The Parliament of Dijon has had
an Inspector of the Order
of Malta arrested, who Lodges and who passes
an Order of the Grand Master.
These Officers quarrel
furiously with the King &c.,
this will have consequences.

Les Armes and Paris will assemble
the day after Tomorrow for the affairs
of the Marshal of Richelieu;
one believes that until the Judgment
there will be two Weeks by
Weeks.

It is true, that the King has
given his Approval to a
Company for the Consolidation
of the Lotteries into one:
This Company must give
30 Millions to the Minister of
War, which will provide for
reimbursing the Offices already
suppressed, and to be suppressed,
in the Military.
