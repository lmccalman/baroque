Friday the 16th of July 1782

Everything is Active in
this Port, and in the Shipyards as
if the War still lasted, the number
of workers has not diminished and the
Construction of the Vessels that
were on the Shipyards before
the Peace, as well as the Repair
of returned Vessels, have not
been interrupted.

The Two last Fluyts being
fitted out that remained to us,
will not go to the North; they
are being loaded with Masts, Wood of all
kinds, ready to be employed, with
Sails, &c; and all that is going to depart
for Toulon.

The Judgment of M. de Ligny,
is not yet rendered.
