nature very Jenuit, & will not be easy to
trace it at once, and what I know of it at
present is so general and so uncertain that I
can not venture to bring it & till I am more
perfectly informed, which I shall make it my
particular business to be.

I have the honour to be most respectfully

                    My Lord

                              Your Lordship's
                              most humble and
                              most obedient Servant
                              R Woltere.
