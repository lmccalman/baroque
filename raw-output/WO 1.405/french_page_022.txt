Mr. Henry        Yr. In. addition is [?] am informed, making
September 14 [?] 1802    the Spanish armament at Toulon which
                makes the whole number of Ships of the
                line appeared preparing for Sea in the
                Ports of this kingdom, amount to 29 - of
                which there are at Ple. Ferrol, two of 112.
                others of 74, and three of 64 - the different

                indicates their destination to be for
