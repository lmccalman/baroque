N°2.

Rotterdam the 6th January 1764.

Sir

By mistake the Amsterdam Barge
of the French and Flemish Mail is gone to
the Hague, and the Hague Barge is come
hither, at the Hour that I was writing
the Mistake is not remedy'd, and
consequently I am not expected to have
the Intelligences in time to have them
ready for the Post.

I have the Honour to be most Respectfully

Sir


Your most humble and
most Obedient Servant

R. Wolters.
