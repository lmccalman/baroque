to Delgy, recently sent some Expenses
to certain Workers, of your apartment at the Court
of audience, to take up the Pens again,
and that by this letter they will consider with maturity
the Chancellor's Projects, and that finally
the Parliament returns with into the Rights,
and triumphs completely. This letter also says that
the Protestants at the same Time
Saurois have offered to the King in the Terms the
Regrets, of seeing the Positions diminish,
and to heat them up; but the Number
of Protestants of Parliament was
considerable. There reigns in this Capital
a Spirit of publication, which makes felt
to the Government the absolute necessity
of maintaining the Projects, and of
consummating them.

It is here that the King, that the Parliament,
can be put back such then 15 Days; it
with Affronts to await it; but
so much and so full, England has succeeded
in all that could happen; it was necessary
a [Rhétoriere], and one would have given it like the
Chancellor, for having dared to undertake
this Government, and to execute it.

From the high Counselor of Great Council
is also of the friendship the other dead,
it is that which formed in France the
Great Chambers.
