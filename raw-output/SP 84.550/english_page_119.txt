Brest the 20th March 1778.

All the Vessels
of the Squadron have arrived
with the exception of the Bourgogne,
which Mr de Monteil judged
appropriate to bring in the
[lettreaux] of its Masts; this
way of reducing the [Mitres]
appeared new, and not very solid.
The Squadron must set Sail
from the 18th to the 20th April; it
takes five Months of Provisions,
which will be consumed at
Sea, for one must only make
two short Calls,
of which one at Lisbon, and
the other at Lagos.
The Brillant, which has replaced
the Indien, departs at this Moment
for the Isle de France.
