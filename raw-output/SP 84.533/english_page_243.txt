Madrid the 20th September 1775.

I have just received
News from Cadix, that the frigate
Queen of War, had arrived from
Cartagena in this Bay, having
on board the famous French Constructor
Mr. Gautier, who, as it is claimed,
will put into Execution the Plan to make
at la Coruce, or at la Ste de Leon, a
[Braglin] to construct and Careen
the Vessels of the King.

The Duke Jean de Crillon, & the Alcade
of 70 Cannons, has set Sail from Cadix
for the Levault.

I am informed from Cartagena,
that Captain Perrela Stork, arrived
On this Roadstead, having all His orders
Under Seal of the King, coming from a
Cruise from St. Maloes.
