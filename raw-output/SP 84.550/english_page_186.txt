My Letters from Alicante of the 8th Current
report, that several Wagons, loaded
with Cannonballs and Munitions, were passing
in the Environs, destined for Badajoz,
for we read the Jesuits at
the Court of Portugal, it appears that one
mistrusts them, for one knows that they have
an Army of 30 Thousand Men
in Paraguay, which gives some
Uneasiness.

I dare nothing New which
merits your Attention.
