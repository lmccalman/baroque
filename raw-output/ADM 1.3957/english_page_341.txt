                    Brussels the 8th September 1770.

                         The troops which have been
assembled at the camp near Mons,
must from next Friday return
to their garrisons, where they must carry
the Heart of the Empress General, which
has arrived here.
            The different masters of each
Regiment have orders to furnish in
their turns an exact table of the
strength of their Corps, and a Statement of the
Recruits that have been made.
            It is moreover enjoined to each
Regiment to furnish the exact Statement
of what has been spent since they have been in
garrison in this Country, as well
as that of the [Ergeley] of the [Daniers].
