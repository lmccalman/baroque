in that of Douay, by the Edict of the month of December 1713, & by
our Edict of the month of June 1731, the Provincial Council of Valenciennes
was extinguished & suppressed to put an end to the disputes which arose
continually between the Officers of the Parliament of Douay & those of
this Council. The resolution in which We are to establish for
our Provinces of Flanders a Superior Council similar to those which
We have created & established by our Edict of the month of February of this
present year, obliging Us to suppress our Parliament of Douay,
We have judged that it should likewise render in place of the service
of any [tes] courts, [redes] to Justice in the jurisdiction of this Parliament, in giv-
ing to our People all the [infinies] securities of their customs &
usages; & in making them participate henceforth in all the other advan-
tages which We prepare for them by a great part of our
[rages], of which We have already made part announced as proper to return to our
Kingdom; in consequence We have judged proper to refer to our
Superior Council of Arras the cognizance & Judgment in Sovereign
of all matters which were to be formerly brought to the Parliament of
Douay. It is thus that in reestablishing the exercise of a prompt Justice
& gratuitous in favor of our Subjects of said Countries; who have always
distinguished themselves by their fidelity; & whom We cherish particularly,
We fulfill with regard to them the views of benevolence & equity which
direct Us. FOR THESE CAUSES, & others moving Us thereto, by
the advice of our Council, & of our certain knowledge, full power
& Royal authority; We have, by our present Edict perpetual &
irrevocable, said, decreed & ordained, say, decree & ordain;
will & it pleases Us as follows:

of our present Edict.

II.

The Seats which formerly fell under the jurisdiction of our Parliament of
Douay, shall henceforth fall under the jurisdiction of our Superior Council of Arras;

created by our Edict of the month of February of this year.
