Paris the 10th January 1903.

There are today
no letters from Brest nor from Toulon.
The ships that must carry the letters that
I send you have not left their ports of call.
I send the Roll of the Captains of Rejouon.
You will see, Sir, but it is true to
render it to him yourself.
The King has received a Courier from Madrid
who brought him a letter from the King and announces to him
the taking of Denia. The Duke of Orleans having been
informed immediately went to the Princess's with
the Regent to Compliment her on the Peace:
She was at the Queen's.
Consequently the Regent has declared, that
the Isle of Sicily must Return, and that there
was no place for Compensation and that, if the
King of England does not Return it, his [Ecrit] that
[vendu] by the Merchant letters of which one had
need from Barcelona, Will be around Madrid.
One enters the Field [conveqe] of the Prelates of the
Council, the Controller general attends likewise with
the Intendant of Classes, one has sent
at the same time Instructions to all
the Ports, as much of alert as of War, of which
the commanding [Me] has been of the War, of which
the order is made, and the most Royal of flames,
to reunite all the Writers, It will act place
moreover, Valencia, [Iurique], Marseilles, and
Bayonne in France for those who are at the
Bay of [Consueil], who are all the [Etrangés] [lequels]
of the Court and of the Capital, but She has a
too Beautiful Soul to favor them always.
