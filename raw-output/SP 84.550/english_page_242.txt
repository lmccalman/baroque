The same day Sunday, I arrived with feet
fresh from the morning, Mr Martin, Chief of the 3rd
part of the King at Sureaux. Mr Marion and Mr Ber-
donier of finances; after the Col (College)
this Minister, who had always eluded Peace
with the King, flattered me ceaselessly but I
Complimenting he had [attestenu] me, but
soon after under the Mask what a King
demands they have they can depose by Regularity
for my Peace, but I regret the Fate
of the Unfortunate, whose
Moment to relieve them I was sending; it is this
Minister returned from the Exchange to Paris
where almost between whom I have been domiciled and
and to duty. Happy with Partisans
but in small Number, they had
against him all the Great, whom he did not
[manageroient] to make the Little ones
happier. One can say of this
Minister, that after the Control he was of
good and upright intentions; but that he was
deceived by the Subordinate Clerks,
and who have seen him badly in the affairs
seconds I have employed will defend
will not return to the Successor.
