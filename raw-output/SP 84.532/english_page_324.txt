There is talk of an upcoming general Convocation
of the three ordinary orders of the Clergy,
to ask them for 6 Million.
They are occupied with examining the acts, which
is nothing other than the Regulation of the
Council, and of the Grand Council, adapted
to the Procedures of the Courts, it could not
[guide], except for very few use for all
the Bailiwicks. Those of the Provinces are
not disposed to this except the Servile.
The Châtelet is still in
Inaction.
The Court of Aides and Petitions,
which permits itself to receive the Regis-
trations of their decrees and iteratives,
on which it works.
The Effects, the Parlements of the Province
in favor of that of Paris, have still
produced nothing.
There is still fermentation in
the Minds, very strong handwritten Letters
are being spread, printed, to engage the
petty nobility to go to the advice of the Blues
and deliver the Principal of the Bastille, to form
Parlements, there will be an action by the
Bailiwicks not to recognize the
Superior Councils.
