Carnival has not been very gay this
year, only very gay, because of these
circumstances of the Parliament, and these
extreme Miseries that reign among the
People.

They write from Bordeaux, that the continual
English leave almost no more
Hope of advancing the Timber Boats,
and it has been resolved to plant
Potatoes there in the Month of March, to make
the Harvest in September, the Terrain
will always be the same for a new wheat harvest,
they say Well.

Good Policing to prevent
Monopolies, has somewhat reduced the Price
of Grains in some Provinces
but in several others the
Misery is very great.

Never has there appeared so many
Pasquinades and such a Spirit of
Discontent, even against what
is most respectable.
