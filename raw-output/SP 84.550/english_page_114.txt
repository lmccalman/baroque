Madrid the 25th March 1776.

The C. of the Convents
arrived here Two Couriers from
Portugal, with the News, that the
England [il l'Extrenite], and the other
Spain [d'en recherger].
There are Two Parties, one in favor
of the Prince of Beira, elder brother of
the Princess of Brazil who is here,
and whom His Royal Highness the King
declares Regent of the Kingdom
during the Minority of the young
King; which is the Party that
Spain, and France, appear
to want to favor and support
in case of Need, to prevent
a Civil War, which appears to
be feared, if the Spirits do not
unite,
