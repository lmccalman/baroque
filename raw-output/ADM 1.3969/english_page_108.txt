Prince Bariatinski did not appear
last Tuesday at Versailles nor Mr.
de Markoff, his Deputy. They were
both found that evening, at
the Opera. Sign of their Good Health.
Since the Eighth of the same Day, these
Ministers sent off a Courier
to Petersburg, without declaring that
their Sovereign is marching
troops, apparently they are
well informed of the Dispositions of
our Court. They agree roughly
that it will be difficult to enter a [Baptême],
the Livre not fulfilling its
Commitments, but if Russia
[tenlat] alone in this new
war, it is doubtful if she will finish
it as gloriously as the Previous one.
There have just passed already into Turkey 40
[re nos] Artillerymen, and 25 Naval Officers,
but no People of Distinction.
