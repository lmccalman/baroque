Harangue
made to the Dorglandes of
Citizens and Bourgeois
assembled on the 13th and 14th December 1766.

Gentlemen

Day, when one must annihilate the Palladium of the State
and of our Liberty. Each of us called
to reflect on the Project that must be delivered to
our Suffrages, sees in it the disturbing appearance & nothing
[avisément] to deprive us of our Rights
in audaciously conceiving them. The King's intimacy,

Rule, of Order, and of Justice, that the Foreigner

to our Regard and to our Choice. On one will be
the [Ionité] of Order itself, on the other France,
and the independence of the Fatherland, the weakening
and the Liberty of the Subjects of Havre. The
painful labors, all that which have been
done until this Day, give us the
firm Hope that our Choice cannot
