The Parliament of Metz has written to the King about the
[Decret] which prevails in its District, & to
request that there be no Encampment
of Troops this Year.

The Tribunal of Auch, that a Capuchin
and a Recollet of Beziers have King, have
made their common cause before the Bishop, & the
peacefully the Gates had gone to Parity
of God, of the [Roqueur] that the Whites
executed these two, that it was time
to Deliver themselves from their tyranny. From the
Consequence all the [Religues] Had revolted
& that all was in Confusion in this
City. It is, they say, from a Vessel arrived
at Le Havre, that this News was known, which
is not guaranteed however.

Fiennes, August 3, 1770.

Here is what I learn:
About Dunkirk, that they refused to
make water flow through the Lock, named
Rosendaël, to see If this would have effect
to clean the Port, and they add that
this Trial did not meet the expectation
which was had.
