The new Minister of Prussia
arrived here four days ago;
and the Duke of la Vauguyon, new
ambassador of France, will necessarily await there,
most of his equipage having already arrived.

Last Friday the King received
an extraordinary courier from
Paris, dispatched by the Count of Aranda
with important dispatches; it is said,
concerning the disputes that arose
between the Emperor and the Republic
of Holland.

Our Infant Don Louis is
ill, as well as the Infanta Dona
Marie Amelie.

The heir Prince François
Janvier was very ill also,
according to the courier from Naples.
