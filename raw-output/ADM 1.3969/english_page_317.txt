Paris the 20. February 1734.

The Gazette de France
will soon give us the news
from India, all that is learned
of M. de La March, is that he
must take five Ships of the line
to India, and that M. Boffen
will arrive in Europe with all
the others, in the Course of the
Month of May next.
They are also leaving in this Country
a numerous Corps of Troops,
the Regiment de la March, will
be Part of it, and as it has
suffered much, they are giving
Fifty Thousand Ecus, to M. de
La March, to recruit it
right away.
