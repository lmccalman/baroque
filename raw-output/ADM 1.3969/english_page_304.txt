will suffer damage, some Colliers
however have perished, with all Hands.

The loan of One Hundred Million
was closed the evening before yesterday.

It appears decided, that the Colonels
à la Suite, are going to be suppressed;
those who no longer obtain
Service, will not be able to claim
the Rank of Brigadiers; nothing has been
decided for the Captains à la Suite.

It is to take the roll of the nobility
that they would have wanted to send Mr
de Brisseglin to Brittany; and not
to command there; this Honor
is reserved for Mr de Montmorin,
who is going to replace the Marshal
de Vaubeterne, in this delicate Position.

It is said at present, that it will be
the Count de Segur; and not Mr de
Narbonne, who will go as Minister
to the Court of Petersburg.
