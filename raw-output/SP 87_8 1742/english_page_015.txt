205

I begin, Sir, by responding
to the first article of your letter, and I will wait
for you to let me know the decision you
will have taken when you are better informed of the matter
by Monsieur l'abbé de Chanterac, who must be
back in eight or ten days and whom I will see
right away; it will be then that I will have the honor of
writing to you at greater length. I am very sorry not
to be able to send you what you wish
presently for the matter of which you speak to me,
but I believe that Madame de La Vrillière
will indicate it to you herself, and I do not doubt
that she will be very obliged to you for the care you
are willing to take on this occasion. I beg
you only not to rush anything and to wait
until I have written to you more fully on this. It only
remains, Sir, to assure you of the perfect
esteem and sincere friendship with which I have
the honor to be

Mademoiselle
                                                       Your very humble
                                                       and very obedient
                                                       Servant
                                                       Mlle
                                                       de Bignon
