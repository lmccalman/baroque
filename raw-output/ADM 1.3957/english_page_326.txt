                                        Toulon the 30th August 1790.

                                                    We still have
no News of our burners,
and are very worried about it.
    Sir whom we send M. [monsement]
Josephine and Cousins.
    We come from a Barque, and a Corvette
which is being built in the Shipyard, to conduct the Review
of all the Vessels and Frigates of the Port;
He has for this brought Workers
from all Parts. We do not know what this
means, and where this will lead us, or will not
lead; and Our Charme has had 20 Crosses of
St Louis.


                                        Brussels the 29th August 1790.

                                                    Our [Permuteurs] are taking away
all the people with them from the Pays de Waes
and are filling the Villages of the Low Countries.
    Much is being shut up so that the Courier
which closed the 27th of August does not respond, it is believed that
the Stage is the [manuscription] made not to respond by
the Post.
    The farm of Warenberg has left by Post
Coach to Vilvoorde; So that he lets go where he went.
