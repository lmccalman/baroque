Paris the 26. May 1782

The [Sémiaire] Rasceau
is only a project destined for Newfoundland, had only put to Sea to
make a Short Cruise. This Vessel
having been constructed by a new
template, they wanted to examine its
Qualities. It has returned to Brest, and
the [projet] appears to have been quite satisfied
with its Performance.

It was learned yesterday, that the [Ratiere]
¶ the Prince of [Raunitz], carrying Imperial
Troops, departing from Cap-Domingues
with a precious Cargo, and 25.
Passengers, perished near the Azores.
Very few People were saved,
and there were on this Vessel some
Officers of our Troops, of which Two
had the Rank of Colonel.

The Spanish Courier has
brought us in the last regular [dispatch] no
interesting News.
