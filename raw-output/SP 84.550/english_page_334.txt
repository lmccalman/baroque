this News, It has been posted,
and the King has been asked, to revoke the
Letters of Cachet which exiled the Duke
of Aiguillon, to leave him free
to go where he would like, with the exception
of appearing at the Court. No one doubts
that the Duke of Aiguillon will leave
Aiguillon immediately, to come to the
estate of Véretz, near Tours; he
is believed too good a Politician, to
appear in Paris, as long as
the Trial of the Duke of Guines lasts; it is believed
that he intrigues against this Duke,
even if he were not doing it.

This exile has caused
a Thousand Reasonings; It proves
they say, the Discredit of the Parliament
Duke of Choiseul, and the great Credit
on the contrary, of Mr de Maurepas,
who does not leave the King. The
other Ministers are still
in Paris, or at Versailles; there has
however been a Courier to Marly;
but this Change strikes all
Minds.
