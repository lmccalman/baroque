Madrid the 25th August 1782.

The Court Gazette has
given us an Account of the Expedition
of Don Barceli; it adds nothing to
what we had already said, and little of
it. Affair.

It still appears that we
hold ourselves by our Guards, for any
Event, and that one does not yet think
of disarming. There are still
Fears on the Emperor's Side,
and many People think that the
Quarrel of the Russians and the Turks
could drag the greater Part of
Europe into a War... we
must see.
