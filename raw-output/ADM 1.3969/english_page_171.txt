Paris the 21st of July 1780

Last Tuesday came a
Courier from London, who was believed to be charged
with the Ultimatum from the Cabinet of St. James
for the Signing of the Treaty; but it
appears that it is still delayed.

The Emperor has decidedly
given the strongest Assurances that he
does not think of entering into War; thus
the accommodation between the Emperor
and the Grand Seigneur, will not suffer
great Difficulties.

Nothing yesterday; we learned by
the Courier from Toulon the arrival in this
Port, of the Vessels the Triomphant, and
the Souverain.
