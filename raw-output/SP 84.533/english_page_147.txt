for d'antheor the 25th, but fortunately for
him, that this is not the Last deed of d'arcy. He was serving
Fort Henry, His Brigandage [n'amble] to no one in my
steps even. When one does not see him always
know the hearts, he will no longer bring himself, and will
show only Nothing [comverchè]. Regard of the
Attention of this Pay, it is always the
same, the Banalities following made debased Soldiers,
one living only on the good [polle] the
last ones, and never does one draw any
Profit from the Advice.

Brussels the 2nd September 1778.

The Remnants of the Regiments
of Ries, d'Arc and D'arce, Form since This
unfortunately Reign, which have gone out in Garrison
in the Low Countries, having been completed for the
Regiment, have formed each two Companies
of Grenadiers, and the Regiments of Ries have passed
before [la lanne] of Ghent, and the two others of
[Romme] passed to Ostend. Are the two not [lumes]
in Belgium, in farms? among all the troops
there were found only one of them to whom hope allowed
that they had been deceived by the Brigandage, who
were sent back the women with a wretched
Soldier, and a [Coron] of Germany, but in
the others responded, that they wanted to stay
or that they were of their own wish that one [Retirast]
them in country.
