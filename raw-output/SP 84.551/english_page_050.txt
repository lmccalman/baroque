Paris the 12th July 1776.

Our Letters from Brest
speak only of the Consequences of the
works that have been commenced there; but
no order yet to arm,
it is assured however, that there will be an
Armament next Month, and another
in October: the Warehouses are being filled,
and they are kept quite ready.
It is not presumed that War is wanted,
but that we wish to put ourselves
in a state to respond to any Event
the various Powers are arming,
it would not be prudent to remain
quiet.

A Vessel arrived from Rothskey
at L'Orient, has reported, that there had
been a very terrible Combat in the
Ganges, that Cheidernagor had
been entirely defeated and that 40
English Vessels had perished there
with all hands and goods.
