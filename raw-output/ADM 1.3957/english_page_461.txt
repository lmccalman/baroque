4 in Nov. N°4

Brest, October 25, 1770.

Twelve [larfueuro] and
[Sice] frigates are already ready, so
that [elle Cores anniment] to arm them, there
will not be a [lien] to put.

They have assembled in the Port up to [acia
cles] extensions of enemy ships burned
at Toulon, and even from Ostend: they are
occupied making [chantours], arrows,
[balones], [Loffuts] of [tharges],
of everything in a word.

There are materials from the North for all
the vessels, but no spares;
no anchors and cables: no
flag and [à tendre le plante secrèt
d'orgé] to make beer; no
water, [Pots à encangelle], and all
the world here is restless. Ignorance
alone [chy enjupique], [d'étoit] everything; they
work vigorously to repair this
negligence.

Precautions are taken against the
plague; a [chrétien] vessel which
from the [rade légère] arrived at
Smyrna, they would oblige [encementé
garde].
