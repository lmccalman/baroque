R. 11 augusto


Paris, July 30, 1784.

We have not yet received
news from Mr. Baralt, since his
departure from Cartagena; the ensign of
Portugal not having found Mr.
Baralt at Cartagena, went to join him
near Algiers.

Since the third day of the departure
of the King of Sweden, we have had no
news of him.

Decree of the King's council of
July 21, 1784, providing exemption from
duties for brandies which
will leave the Kingdom, with freedom
to distill the lees, the [balmeires] of
wines and the grape pomace.
By this decree the price of brandies
will be considerably reduced.
