Paris the 6th October 1782.

     The Russian Empress, pretext
Kronstadt, is too weak, and too poorly
equipped for one to think, despite
the assistance that she could have found
in England, of sending it into the
Mediterranean, and it appears decided
today by the great number
of Officers of the Marine that she has on
board, that they only make it leave to
navigate some time in
the Baltic, for the instruction of
these young people.
     The response that the Empress
made in writing to our Court; is the
true expression of her sentiments;
She would desire nothing so much today,
than to remain in peace with the Turks,
to have the time to extend her
domination in the countries that she
has appropriated to herself, in a

lasting manner
