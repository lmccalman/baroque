of these Conferences. People who should
be informed, claim that nothing has
been decided in the Conferences of Paris
and Versailles, and that the Proposals
of Prince Henry have not been
received. I would be rather inclined
to believe it. This Prince decidedly left
Paris on November 2nd; He will tarry that
day and the next, at Chantilly,
at the Prince of Condé's; the 4th and 5th
He was at St. Raphaël at the Duke of Orleans';
and the 6th He departed, taking his Route
by Strasbourg, [Eolka], Cassel, and
Brunswick. He will tarry principally
in the Two last Places.
This Prince received last Week
the King's Present, which consists of
Porcelain from Sèvres of the greatest
Beauty, of the Value of nearly One Hundred
Thousand Ecus.
