From Sargé in Portugal the 8th June 1716.

Our father-in-law to monsieur the
sieur le, suggested to me the idea that they
should not see Madame having seen her:
[la plûture], for is it not the Duke
of Chartres, wrote to la legardiere,
in tacking one and the other;
all the fleet comes from the Princes,
there is nothing to say, the Damage
is not what he believes it to be.
Mr. du Chaffelet sent his
two Vessels to the said [place], to
repair them. The Prince was
at first more content with this
Adventure, than his ambition was
to see the other, they have made fruits.
As soon as he will be returned here;
& [Celuder] his [arri] in [ifte], or
a Month, after which she will make
a Second Stop at [l'istonne],
unless the Galleys of the Court
opposed here by la Bourelle, which
Mr. des Borres commands, order
otherwise.
