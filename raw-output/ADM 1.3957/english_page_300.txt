we will see if this Example will lead to
others; it is certain that we have
a good Deal of it, if once Fear
seizes them.
    That is where we Stand; and there is
Appearance that Affairs will remain
yet some time in the same
Situation.
    On the other Hand we have every
reason to fear, that a Postal
Boat, of which we have no
News, has been taken by the
Barbary pirates; it carried an
Artillery Captain, and one from the
Corsican Legion, Nephew of Mr de Vaux.
We are not, as you see,
in a happy Position.
