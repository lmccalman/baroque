of a Project of Government, which
contains up to Cardinal de Richelieu.
    The Parlements who work so much, and
who employ their time on the upcoming
Deliberations, and make Efforts to
break the execution; but they will not
succeed at it. One needs goods and
Patience, and everything comes
with time.
    The registration of the new Code,
and the installation of the new Parlement
is postponed until after the Easter
Vacation which will begin the day after Tomorrow.
    If our Parlement has an Aspect
to the old Danish one, the fate and the strange
thing is that the Parlement will [biger] at
Castle of Merdin Saint. It has orders
to go there, and to make the visit of
the Prisons. The Châtelet which does not
recognize the Parlement, is
decided to refuse Obedience;
and to have the Doors closed.
There will be a fallen World; one
fears some riot.
