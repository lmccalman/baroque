Paris September 22, 1782

We are still concerned here with the
Prussians and the Turks and we continue to keep
an Eye on the Emperor. We are unaware of what
has happened in Crimea since the
Generals of the Empress had
the Tartars swear an Oath of fidelity
as well as the Resolutions of the Divan, as
soon as it will have been ministerially
informed of this taking of Possession by Russia.
It is certain that the Sovereign of the
North has put everything into use to
engage us to remain Neutral, [au quel] our
Allies in this great Quarrel, but
it is very difficult to persuade oneself that she
has written, a short time ago to Mr de
Vergennes. Engage your Master instead
of crossing my Projects to sell his
Soldiers to my Enemy, that he will go [moueller]
for the [Septiens], it is there, and in the middle
of his Seraglio, that I have given Order
that one Salute the Sultan on my Behalf
with a Thousand Cannon Shots.
