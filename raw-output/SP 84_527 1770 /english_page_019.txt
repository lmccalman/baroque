Nantes

K p[?] October 1770

[The main body text is difficult to read clearly due to the handwriting style and image quality. While I can see continuous cursive French text arranged in what appears to be letter or document format, I cannot make out enough individual words with sufficient confidence to provide an accurate transcription of the full text content. The visible elements include dated correspondence notation and what appears to be formal French prose in 18th-century administrative style.]
