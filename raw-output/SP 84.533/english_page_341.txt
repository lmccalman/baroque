Vienna, November 28, 1773.

The Emperor will arrive here
Wednesday [une Fleur de Lis Messi], in a
good State of Health, but very magnificently,
no one expected him here.

The Letters from Warsaw of the 6th arrived here
this Evening at 3 O'clock, make Mention only of
50 Persons, instead of 60, who have reached
the King, some of them have already been taken.

Since Wednesday the Bourki departs today
in this Piece, that the Turks have received
near the Danube, but one does not know at all
about Battles, one speaks that the difference
still of the summer subsists. The Battle of the [Meil]
given, that some say near
Gruzgow, others near Cagsee,
and most that they are not far from
Pukacoits. It is therefore necessary to await
further Advice through this difference
before one can believe them.
