N° 13 Sep 8

Paris, August 29, 1782

M. de Sanxel, son of the Ship
Captain of that Name, arrived at
L'Orient by the Corvette la Fortune
coming from Trinquemale, whence he
departed on the 13th of April. At the Time
of his Departure, M. de Saffron was to
return to Trinquemale, and was going
to prepare to leave there, to
return to the Coromandel Coast.
It is added, that the English Squadron
was in poor Condition, and inferior
to ours, thus M. de Saffron
was quite tranquil on that side.
M. de Eussy arrived on the 13th of March at
Trinquemale, he was doing very
well, as were his Troops, at the
time of M. Sanxel's Departure.
However the Sick have carried off
several Men from the Garrison
of Trinquemale, since the Month
of January last.
