done in Berlin, which announces a
Crisis, hotter than ever
between these Two courts; however,
as the News from Berlin
continues to make one regard the
Health of the King of Prussia as
very shaky, which they assure
that despite his State [l'on l'emporté
appartiend], the court of Merle
with which he is threatened, is not
destroyed, and that he is given
to live at most only until
the end of Autumn, one thinks here
and one holds oneself ready for any
event. This eventual catastrophe
ought to produce
some Revolution in the
North, it is another Motive
to which one attributes our
preparations.
