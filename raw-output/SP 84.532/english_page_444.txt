Paris the 18. April 1773.

We have, Mademoiselle,
no news from our Brothers, without Doubt he
remains because there is nothing new.
It is believed that Madame the Dauphine has [nom-
suche] much more the abbot they heat up.
The News of the Ratification of Avignon
is not confirmed.
The King arrived [falfés foncées] at the theater, is
she well from Versailles, the Princes have been
summoned to the hunt, and it is believed that the King
declared to them that day what he will judge appropriate
for the good of the State.
The King has finally named a Minister of
the Navy, it is M. Bourgeois de Boynes,
Counselor of State.
M. de Maurepas becomes general at
the same time by virtue Archduke of Regnier,
brother of Humanists of France. He no longer has the
[tenonnands], they want to confer them
to M. Pizon, [examinant] of state at justice
of this committee to give there permission
very advanced. One would not be astonished to
prevent me from bishop of Orleans and the
Taxes, to make them render account.
I am not surprised either that here
empty, there was a Son who serves to have written
the duke of Chauvelle, and M. de La Roche, to
have from them only gently armed Men,
there as if to get rid of, nothing in
seeing to employ.
