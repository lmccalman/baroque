     Paris the 19th September 1782

               We learn by
an Express sent by the Commerce
of Madrid, that the Captain Patron of the
[Truites] of Peace, arrived at St.
Adelphonne on the 8th of this Month in the morning;
that is to say, in Four Days and 20 Hours.
There is only one single Example of such
Diligence; one will find upon
calculating the Length of the Roads
that this Courier must have made three Leagues
per Hour. The Express that announces to us
the [Destituer des Italicries flottantes] comes
from Madrid in Four Days & Hours.
     Mr Imbert is doing better, there is appearance
that he will soon be in a State to resume
his Portfolio.
     The Duke of Croysy, Colonel General
of the Dragoons having given the Resignation
of this Position, the King has disposed of it in favor
of the Duke of Luynes, the latter is succeeded by
the Marquis of Croysy.
