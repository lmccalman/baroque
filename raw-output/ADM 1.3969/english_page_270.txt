Vicar of the King, Mr. François de Paulet
de Vilanova, Jesuit was from [Jésiden] fallen.
The Misfortune would have been much more
considerable; this Vessel finding itself at the

until Reimbursement, but having
received the News that the Intendant of
Havana was equally seizing
by the same Order the Two other
Millions of strong Piastres, that this
same Commerce was involving with the
last Loan-funds, one can judge
