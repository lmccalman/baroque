My Lord Duke.

Late last Tuesday night I had the following
Information given me; that Hintock Mordaunt now
in the Ile of Egg has made a Contract with the
Crown of France to furnish Seven hundred men to
recruit the Scotch and Irish Regiments in the
French Service; that a Ship is actually filling
up in one of the Ports of France, to fetch them over
to and fro; and that as a Blind Mordant has written
letters from his friends in France, wrote to ask
Musket and then the men are called Black Cattle.
    I can not upon the truth of this informa-
tion as I very much suspect the person who gave it
me and who has of his own accord promised to
inform me of what he can learn, I shall soon be
able to see if he deserves to be encouraged or not.
