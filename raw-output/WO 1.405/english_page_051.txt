Hibernd Byrne &    The 8 th the Hibernian Targets of 39 then came
Estlegrove 11th Sept 99  passed out of the arsenal, and proceeded to the
             Hardesty Barracks. Almeria and from with only the
             men on board in order to being made included forces
             from thence, and yesterday the Argyle with Traads of
             39 then came to the manner out of the arsenal, is
             it appeared impossible to get them to Barraterre on a
             similar errand. Two more left of the tea and
             a frigate are in great forwardness and may
             probably be fit for sea before than the Byrne can be
             repeated back.

             Yesterday the Artillery Brig just back a second
             time from about Port a Respect Squadron, and this
             morning the Sirene an after frigate they say
             just been obliged to put into Armenia greatly
             damaged.
