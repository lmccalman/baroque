Beaurepaire Affair

My Lord

I have the honor to represent to Your Grace that the Sieur de Beaurepaire, prisoner at Fort l'Eveque since the 14th of January last in consequence of your orders, has asked me several times to let him know when he might hope to leave prison, that I have always delayed responding to him while awaiting the orders of Your Grace.

This prisoner is in a very unfortunate situation, his wife and his children are without assistance, it is to be feared that the length of his detention may put him in the position of never being able to satisfy his obligations.

I have the honor to observe to Your Grace that the Sieur de Beaurepaire was not put in prison for debts, but only because of some heated words that he permitted himself in a meeting of creditors.

If Your Grace judged it appropriate to grant him his liberty, I take the liberty of representing to you that it would perhaps be appropriate to oblige him to provide security to present himself whenever he may be required to do so, and not to leave Paris without permission.

I have the honor to be with profound respect

My Lord

Of Your Grace

The very humble and very
obedient servant
