Whitehall 2d May 1749.

Sir,                                233

I received the Lords Last
Tuesday Night with your Letter
of the 9th Inst. Rel: de Ypres, and
that of the 18th do.
... As to what you mention
with Respect to the Effects I
should be of Opinion, if the
Royal Regiments have no
Occasion to go into those
Barracks, which the Royal
Allemands have thought fit
to appoint Mr Walters to,
in Conveniency Mr Cunningham
Returns, Representations
upon that Account should
be made good to him out
of his Contingences for this
War; & as to the Question
of that Contribution, I
am persuaded that the
Royal Regiment will not
insist upon so gross a
proposition as to the Manor
of his Service, of which
the misfortune we owe
our self, may make amends
what is usually given to
agents employed on
Commission of this Sort
I am with great truth
&c &c
Chas. Dyne.
