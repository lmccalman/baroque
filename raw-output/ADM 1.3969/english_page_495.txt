that there is a Treaty of Alliance on
the Table, of which Prince Henry has
laid the Foundations. We shall not
be able to have Certainty on
these Objects until next Spring;
and certainly the King of Prussia
will make no Movement until
the Imperial Army has arrived
in the Netherlands.

The Colonels await today
their last Orders, as well as the
Campaign Regulations, which becomes
necessary, since on the 15th of January
the Officers must be informed
of the Number of Horses that will be
passed to them; and the Suppliers of the
Quantity of Forage that they will require.
