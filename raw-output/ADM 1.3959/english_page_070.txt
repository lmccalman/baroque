The Marquis of Grimaldy, Grand of Class of
the Kingdom, attacks the Prince of Montalon
to have him declared unworthy of fulfilling the
functions whatsoever belonging to him
as Masculine Chief: The Officers were
all of unanimous opinion, but the Prince refused
to acknowledge it. The Affair is referred to the
council of the Prince's Ministers.

The Affair of the Count of Monrepos which
made so much noise, was judged definitively yesterday
provisionally. Nobles in league, rebellious Men
and celebrated miseries have begun
their Campaign in 6 Hours, and the Province
has reason to worry that they are not forced
so that all the Parties interested
in this singular Affair, would be
[decorées] with Arrest Warrants, in order to be
interrogated separately, and let us try
thereby to discover the Guilty party.

The Agents have done their work with
vigor. The General Prosecutor has made a case
the Procedure which has been referred to the
castle as necessary, forbidding him
to send similar ones to Courbin,
he names the Bourgeois Goncourt
Secretary against the two Parties
[reuanques] the Affair to Parliament [une
tres] in ten days; so that this Law
be put into force in all the Provinces
and prominent delivery to the Aldermen of the
[Pachemens].
