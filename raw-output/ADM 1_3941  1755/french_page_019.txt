to sail for Holland, when Justice by Order of
the Governor hawled into the Harboeur, for
fear of my giving Intelligence of what passed
to two English Frigats that were cruizing off
of that Port:

The french fleet Sailed the 3d May
consisting of
19. Ships of the Line from 50 to 64 Guns: The
Admiral's Ship carries 84. Guns.
Seven or Eight of these Ships were
so much loaded with Stores, Ammunition,
and particularly heavy Cannon that they
had no Guns in their lower Tiers, and the
Portholes were caulked.
7. Ships from 30. to 36 Guns
4. Sloops well furnish'd with Provisions &c.
All the Ships were much crowded
with Sea- and Land-Men, and so much encumbred
and
