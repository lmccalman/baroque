It has been decided, it is said, that
Mr de Malesherbes will not leave
his Position until after Pentecost,
because he began in the
council the report of an Affair,
which he must finish, and which
cannot finish before at least
15 days.

The Count of Guinnes, very
protected by the Queen, has
just been made Duke by Brevet
under the name of Duke of Guines,
in recognition of his Services:
this does not announce a
triumph for Sieur Tort,
against whom he has a very
tangled Affair. This Mister
Duke will not return to London,
the Marquis de Noailles was
appointed the day before yesterday, to
replace him in the Embassy
to England.
