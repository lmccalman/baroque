Quarter. It is inconsistent with the
Secrecy of our Employment to write
People to the Secretary of State to
say that our Salaries are in Arrear
and this not being publicly known,
Aspersions would with Difficulty be
We All do therefore most humbly lay
this our Case to My Lord Grenville
His Lordship to procure for us such
immediate Assistance, as in his Wisdom
and Goodness His Lordship shall see fit
I am with great Respect,
                    Sir,
            Your most obedient and
            most humble Servant,
                    John Ernest Bode
