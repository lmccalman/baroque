The partisans of M. Necker are
hardly [contento] with M. Requier; they
claim that he poorly defended the
mayor of Bordeaux, and that he conceded too
much to the tribunal. The Parlement
itself appears divided on this affair
and there is because M. d'Epremesnil has
many enemies, and jealous ones
in his corps, who regard
this affair today as his
own.

It was a matter in the same
session of the increase on wine
to burn, that the Wood of Vincennes be
brought to two livres ten sols per voye
of counted wood, and three livres and
fifteen sols per voye of floated wood.
The Parlement consents to the first
because it is only borne
by rich people, but it opposes
the latter, in that it would fall
on the poor people, the bakers
&c, who only burn floated wood.
