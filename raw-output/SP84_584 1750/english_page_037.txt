one of them not Revd Troyard leaving-
having told me that he himself (as late
freighter of the ship Abram, Danl Jasper
master of stem, mentioned in the king of
Suspino, last of damages) had paid all
damages done to the said ship, as he proved
to me by the original receipts.
I have desired him to give me a declaran
on of the fact, as he protests; that the Englishers
have no demand to make on this head, which
he has very readily done, and I send it enclosed.
not Troyard assured me that there are
several pastable cases in the said left but he
has not been able to get proofs of them.
I thought it my duty to transmit this
proper to your Grace, which if it is being-
troublesome if the Instruments works-
                                                I hope
