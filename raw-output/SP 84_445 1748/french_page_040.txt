My Lord Duke—

I was misinformed when I did your Grace
last part, that several of the heads of the law
meeting at Leyden were retained, for I now hear,
that the magistrates, according to the usual good
management in this country, instead of removing
the first officers of the towns that Joined the Regales,
at the approach of the Troops, in laying hold of the
chief mutineers, to save dues by their punishments
had given them time to escape before the conclusion
of the Provincial High courts & Justice appointed to
judge them had reached Leyden.—

If after this escape, it is still thought
necessary to make examples the Judges must dive
into older offences, & I am persuaded that the way

Napole—

Duke of Bedford.
