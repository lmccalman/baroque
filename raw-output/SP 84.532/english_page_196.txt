me whose execution was impossible, he could
arbitrarily increase revenues to the pre-
judice violating particular properties.

Considering that said Court that one has given
to the Magistrates who compose said Parliament
of Paris, hopes which were taken from them
as soon as they had facilitated for them the
means of reconciling their submission to the
wishes of said Lord King, with their honor
& the maintenance of the Laws of the State.

That it is uniquely their generous
& unanimous perseverance in their duty which
has precipitated them into all the misfortunes by which
the Nation has been dismayed; that it is reduced
to abandoning their constancy, & that one has
deployed against them the frightening apparatus of au-
thority to bring them to violate the oath which
bound them to the Decrees of their Company, &
to fail in the secrecy of deliberations; so for-
mally prescribed by the Ordinances.

That by abusing the sacred name of said Lord
King, one came to surprise them in the middle of
the night & in the bosom of their families, to
extract with violence a consent which they
could never be the effect of a free
& considered deliberation; indecent treatment, contrary
to the spirit of goodness & of justice of said Lord
King, & of which it would be desirable that one could
hide the knowledge from posterity.

Considering finally that said Court that the sud-
den substitution of Members of the Council to the Par-
liament of Paris, is in the eyes of the Law
& of the Peoples only a powerless effort to
confound violently the one, & to poison
the cry of the others; that these substitute Officers ful-
fill Ministries incompatible with their
oath & their ordinary functions; that the
list of these Officers, which is found printed
following the Letters-Patent of 23 January
last, is so intended to create illusion
to the Public, that several of those whose
names are employed there are absent; that o-
thers do not have the qualities required by the Law
to perform the service of the Courts of Magis-
tracy: that all can be [urpés] from
the reformation of judgments that they them-
selves would have rendered: that one only wants
to give henceforth a simulacrum which must dis-
appear at the slightest breath, because it is
the plaything of arbitrariness, & that it has no cha-
racter of stability.
