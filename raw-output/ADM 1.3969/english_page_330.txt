Madrid the 22nd February 1788,

     One hears spoken
of from all parts, only of horrible Tempests
and Shipwrecks, especially on our coasts
of Galicia, Biscay, and Bayonne,
as well as on the Coasts of Portugal,
and particularly on the Bar
of Lisbon and on the Tagus
where several Vessels have perished
with all hands.

     It appears that we are
very content with the Peace made between
Russia and the Porte, the Chargés
d'Affaires of the Empress has
received the News from her Court
and a Letter from Mr de Bulgakoff
from Constantinople, which he has communicated
to the Court.
