It is assured that the Sole Obstacle which is
encountered there, is on the Side of the other
Branches of the House of Bourbon,
who would persist in wanting the Destruction
of the Order. Politicians go so far as
to claim, that the Chancellor, and the Duke
d'Aiguillon in concert, seek
to destroy all the Works of the Duke
de Choiseul, would profit from this Sort
of Division, to break the Family
Compact, at which the Jesuits
work strongly on their Side.
    It is said today, that it is not
for having the Assistance of the Jesuits,
that the Secretary of Embassy of
Portugal in Rome, was arrested,
but for Indiscretions concerning
the Secrets of His Court.
