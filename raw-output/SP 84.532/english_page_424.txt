                                           It is reported from
Rodersfort, that O. Rives Claparede, was to

the Count of Mercury, who had ten from
Martinique, [M.lle] Dallivé the navigator.

It is written from Brest, that they continue there to
dismiss daily Workers from the

to the Beneficiaries and Foreign
Ministers, His Majesty has only been at
Versailles this Week, He must go

the New St. Germain.

They do not cease to spread Rumors
of every Kind, one does not know where one is,

must perish, it is also said today that there are
two forms of present together, one
must not believe the Truth.
