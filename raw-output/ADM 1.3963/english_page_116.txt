Mr Blondel Master of Requests,
is particularly for Commerce,
and all that relates to it; it is to him
Joined the Detail of Coinages
These two Appointments well
prove, that the Diogenes of Mr
Berryat is only fable, for both
are very much creatures.

The Comptroller General
has not yet done anything new;
One judges only, from the
Manner in which he received the Chiefs
of the Administration, that he
will perhaps have some severity,
that he is going to rid us of this
[Bagaye] of Mr Berryat: He
received them very coldly;
He told them, that they would have
no business with him; that he was
relieved of this Task by Mr
D'agny, General Intendant of
Posts; And that they address themselves for
henceforth to him. This Mr D'agny was
very much at odds with Mr Berryat.
