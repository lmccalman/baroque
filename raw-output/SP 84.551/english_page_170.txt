No 87

                                    Toulon the 5th April 1776.

                              The Serge has put out
to the Grille, to give Chase to a
Vessel from the Roads and Anticlez,
which has just intercepted the Neapolitan
Ships, which brought us
daily Wheat from the
C. Albanes.

     The Lyon has just been set afloat.
I no longer have Doubts nor
Difficulties about the Sacrifices of the
Work.

     There is an ordinance for the
uniforms of the Infantry of the
Marine, and another for the
Engineers, and Artillery.

     Mr de Leyas, Inspector General
of Provisions of the Marine, has arrived here,
without being expected.

     The last Courier has brought us
another three Galeriotes, and 18. Convicts from
[Lances] of the Marine.
