My Lord Duke

I take the liberty to give your grace joy
of the news from Hispaniola, as this we have the
particular yet of the affair at Leganes I believe
that the loss that the French have sustained there
particularly in shipping must be considerable.
    The mob was up yesterday at Leiden, and
was very busy last night in pulling down
houses; there was also something of the kind at
the Hague, but I believe this is a great mischief
was done; they were threated with a military
force all standing, but the mob give it out that
next Thursday is the day that they have marked
out, which I hope rather magistrates have now
time to prepare will be prevented.
    All these motions seem bring the Prince
of Orange to the deliverance of doing what the People

Desire

his grace the Duke of Bedford.                                          y
