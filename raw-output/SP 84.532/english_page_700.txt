could well harm moreover a little
too hastily, for according to me,
the time of three Years is very short
to be able to judge well on the talents
and on the Pretensions that may have
a man in such Affairs,
and this can be a Pleader, who
in a term of one of one of years exhausts
all that he is made of, and the fruits
of deploying all his know-how.
every beginning is difficult,
interesting events will not
present themselves every Year,
and one must not suppose, that a
[de Bretons], besides that, there is much
more to wager on a matter in
progress, than I have not received for this
Quarter, in the hope, notwithstanding
that I should continue, longer,
but that in the future, I would have
earned an Increase
in Remuneration, to compensate me
for the past.
I pray you to convey
my respects to your chiefs, in the
[qu'on].
