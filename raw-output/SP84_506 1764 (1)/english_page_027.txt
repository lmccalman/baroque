Toulon, September 24, 1764.

They are arming diligently
here, for the Convoy Escort, in all of
2800 Men, the frigate l'Authorise, commanded
by Mr. Vaucher, the Xebecs le Requin and la
Sentinelle by Messrs. d'Espinouze, and
Caillaud, the mortar galiots de Vilore:
Departure is set for October 15.

Many Cannons are arriving here,
but always so defective, that they will
not withstand the Test of the [Boulet à
rame], which one refuses to have executed.
We have the Batteries of [C. Vieuxfaux]
of 64; of n of 74; and of one of 80, and
all that [s'émy] perhaps not half
good; it is the abuse of attaching
to the Number of [Vieuxfaux] without estimating
the destructible Pieces in our own
Armies; one does not know the hospitality
of the Court in Supporting Mr. Maritz in
the supplies and arrangements.

Construction Woods are arriving
slowly.                                                 Paris
