Toulon, February 31st 1775.

We will continue to
favor completing the putting of our
Ships and Frigates in good Condition,
despite the declared Peace, but there is
an Offer to finally finish the Buildings and
the Land Batteries.

Brest, February 18th 1775.

We have no
cessation of our functions; and the Peace
is as lively as can be.

Since then 70 Barques have arrived at Livres,
a Vessel loaded with
pounds; and another with provisions
I believe however that everything will change;
and we expect that Sunday or
Wednesday we will receive the order to
dismiss many workers and to
send them away.

Today the Roland will be put to
Sea, and on Tuesday the Joyeuse will have
the Hercules put to it, both of 64
Cannons, they have not been long in the
Shipyards.
