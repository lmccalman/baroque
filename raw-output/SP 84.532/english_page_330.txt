The latest letters from Vienna of the 7th
say, that there are great Movements
at the Court; that Knitz is so constrained there
that the draft cards, strong between
that Court and that of Berlin, and that
the Declaration of War against the Prussian
Majesty is not far off.

The true or the false of these Rumors,
will soon manifest itself.

I am informed from Saxony, that they are
sending to Cassel the Regiment of Royal
Infantry; but I cannot yet
assure you of the Truth
of this Information.
