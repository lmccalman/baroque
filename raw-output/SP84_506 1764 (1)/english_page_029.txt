to which Circumstances do not permit
to counter, and it appears to decide that the merchants
to the Company are the same People as She and
must reach her before.

Here is precisely and at base the current State
of this company. The First Man, and
the Vow of the Sale made in the Orient,
is M. the Mis de la Rue-Ouest de la Porte du
has generously permitted to pursue
Commerce there until further notice. And
these Syndics and the Directors work
much for the Improvement of this
Commerce. What proves better that the
King does not wish to burden it with the Debts of
France and Bourbon, is that they are going to
arm 4 Vessels and 4 Frigates at Port
on the Third of September to transport
4 Thousand Men to these Islands, the transports
have not been given, and I had the news of it
They are arming in the Port which is uniquely
that the [chatelleur] to go to Martinique
to relieve the Brigade on Sail.

The King departed yesterday Evening to go
to Fontaine, and Tomorrow all the Court of
evening; I have chosen, and Tomorrow all the Court will
find itself at Fontainebleau

The Duke of Choiseul was to return
only on the 4th to Fontainebleau, and has returned from
Versailles
