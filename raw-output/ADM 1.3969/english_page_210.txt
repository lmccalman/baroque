It is reported from Barcelona of the 9th
of the Current [month], that the Rumor was
general in this Port, that one expected
there an Embarkation of
Troops, and Munitions for
Naples and to receive the orders of
the Court to hold oneself ready for any
Event. The Count del Asfalto
was to depart for Naples the 15th
of the Current [month], according to the same Letters.

It is said here that France is sending
an Army to Italy; that the King
of Sardinia is for us, and
that we will give Twelve Battalions
and Twelve Squadrons many
Munitions, and a Squadron if
Needed. One goes so far as to say
that the Two Ministers of Imperial
Courts, could well
leave us. This is at least the public
Rumors, what is certain, is that one
does not trust the Emperor too much.

Leo.
