Having gained this intelligence I did not
think it prudent for my business was urgently
plished to risk any chance of being detained, in
conveying the people with a few prisoners to be
lieu, who seemed very thankful and satisfied.
I stood out to Sea again - The Fishing Boat
stood directly in to Terrot. At ten at I that morning
we discovered from the Mast head a large open
ship at Sea with a prize of hers: We soon
therefore as it was well dark, I allered our
course & Marie, and had the satisfaction I
see no more of her in the morning.

I hope you will approve of my not waiting
into the Port of Terrot, as I am confident
that the appearance of such a dreadful, at this
particular Crisis, would have given sufficient
cause to support her Brand and to justify the
detaining her. I have only to remark
in conclusion that here was no thing & Ship
laying at terrance.
