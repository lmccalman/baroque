                                                            Paris the 30th October 1772.

                                            The Port of Rochefort is
                    absolutely established as for the other times,
                    and one does not see that to construct in the future all
                    the convoys of Provisions for our Colonies,
                    and it is the most proper for this object and
                    that which does great Good for the City, and none
                    not very Common.
                              The Merchants have seen up close the
                    [Cormaches] of India, which have exported
                    carried in their Projects, they have there
                    no friend to [contriver]; which
                    means that one cannot have established
                    this Establishment of the Company of the Indies:
                    At the Watch that one does not go from the destruction
                    the Project is well taken to have it reborn,
                    but the Form embarrasses that the figures
                    are lacking, one seeks all Possible Means
                    to reestablish the Commerce
                    and there is no more of it; however one says
                    that this will be done for the 1st of January.
                              It appears, that the three Powers
                    who have partitioned the unfortunate Poland,
                    will well contain the third of the
                    Kingdom. Denmark has disarmed
                    Lord in the Part of Asia
                                                                      [Maligne]
