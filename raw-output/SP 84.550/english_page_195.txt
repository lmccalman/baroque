The Officers who have had Governorships
have been obliged to surrender the Persons
they had, to help raise the
[Bâtas] of the State.

The Marquis de Pontourme, Governor
of the Island of Sardinia, is named Lieutenant
General of Eight Colleges where there will be
students, while not retaining the salary
of Governor.

Our Politicians have something to exercise themselves with:
It has been more than Eight [Cours], that people speak of
War between Spain and Portugal,
and that France does not want to leave, and
the Island of Corsica, to the Spanish; which does
not appear probable for our allies;
but the day before yesterday Morning, a
Council was held at the Count de Maurepas's house,
which lasted Two Hours, in which
were the [fleurs] of the Government,
Vergennes, Sartine, Montbarrey, and the
Count of Aranda, on Spain's
projects. This Council revived
the [flûtes] that have circulated, and the [fleurs]
Thousand Reasonings, that Time
will teach us, and but there is
much to say about being undeceived about
future time.
