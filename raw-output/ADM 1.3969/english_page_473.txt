Vienna the 20th. November. 1784.

The Dispatch that the Emperor has just
made to the Netherlands, of several
Saddle Horses drawn from his Stables,
Has led to a Subject of alarm from which
one could understand the rumor that is spreading
anew of the approaching Departure of
His Majesty for these Provinces.
It is assured however that He has postponed
this Journey to the end of the Year; but
as everything is ready for it, it is probable
that His Majesty will set out on the Road
as soon as the Courier expected imminently
from Versailles, will have learned what we
must hope for, or fear, if it is
claimed that the Content of his Dispatch
could be of a Nature to determine
the Monarch to go as far as Paris.
The Artillery is ready to be
transported, contracts are being made to
this Effect with Carriers, who
demand a Thousand Florins to transport
