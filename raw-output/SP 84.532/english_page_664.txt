Madrid, May 30, 1785.

After the departure of [ces] the last post, I have received word from Cadix,
that several vessels of war;
Among which the number [n'y avoit trouvé]
in the said port from the departments of
Carthagena [en l'seu] order from the Court
to go there as soon as possible, to be
disarmed there; that in effect all these
vessels were preparing to set
sail, and will in all likelihood have arrived [au
foin de vacances] at their destination
Those who [tendent] from the departments of
Cadix, have [leurs] the order to disarm;
since it appears that no armed [Brigfeau] is kept in the
said ports.
I have nothing more to indicate to you
for the present, and I fear that the
news from our quarters will become
very sterile.
