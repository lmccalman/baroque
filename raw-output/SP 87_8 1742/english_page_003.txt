I was going, I said, to pay my compliments to Madame de Pompadour, when I encountered in the antechamber the Sieur de Voltaire who was leaving it. We greeted each other; and as he appeared to me to have a very cheerful air, I asked him if he was content with his audience. "Yes truly," he said to me, "I am very satisfied with it; Madame de Pompadour received me with much kindness, and did me the honor of telling me that she regarded me as a man who had well merited of the country." I congratulated him on this flattering distinction, and I told him that I was going in my turn to present my respects to that illustrious Lady. "You will do well," he replied to me; "she is full of wit and grace, and she likes to oblige men of letters." We parted on that note, and I entered Madame de Pompadour's chambers.
