Whitehall 28th October 1763.

Sir
     Information having
been received from Dublin
that a very considerable
Quantity of Beef to the
Amount of Twenty Thousand
Barrels, has been contracted
for by order of the French
Court; and that the Barrels
are all owned by Owen
Roche; which seems to
indicate that these Stores
are destined for a very
long Voyage; I am directed
by the Earl of Egremont
to send you the earliest
Intelligence of these
Particulars, in order that
You may make the most
effectual Enquiries &c
