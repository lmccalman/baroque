Private Letter

Paris the 31st May 1725.

It is assured that the
Chancellor has asked the King for
Foreign affairs, in opposition to
Madame de Peurry, who had had them under
the Duke of Orleans, and it is believed that
it is he who will have them.

Besides the fact that this Request must have
put the Chancellor in bad standing in the Mind
of Madame de Peurry, it is also said
that among the affairs of the [Approches]
to the Dispatch of the Chatelet, that which
happened at the Majority, that one
had equally brought this the State to the
[chateles], had been done hastily; but
the [pluspart] better informed, expressed
to him her Discontent about it;
to which he responded, that he himself
had been imposed upon, and
that the Presidents of the Chatelet had
suppressed the Facts from him.
