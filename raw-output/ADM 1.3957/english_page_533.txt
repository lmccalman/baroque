¶     The King in Council decreed the reading of the treaty of
the Minister which was made of it, the Delegations have been attached
to expedite the Letters Patent thereof.

¶     The King upon learning that such was the counsel of this affair was
very satisfied: that of the Parliaments, they finished,
the sole intention of everyone.

¶     The King having been informed of the good will of various
[firmens]; the Edict of Police of which one
speaks was examined. It is three times in writing; the
council of justice was informed of the
Ambassadors and the other same which has passed,
was signed in the Remonstrances to
be brought to the King their [libellés] by the
First Presidents: These Remonstrances
may be conceived in the manner prescribed
in the Royal code.

The Remonstrances state in substance,
that there being no Material to deliberate on
the Edict; the Reason of State having called to
refuse them, and to remove from the Person a
malicious Minister, who gives Him
bad Counsel, the idea of having exiled him
had been taken, of having had their
Roles withdrawn, and to punish him as [l'entelligen tems]
of public order.

The King responded to these Remonstrances the
family against the Chancellor, the [Represens]
directors.

Pardoned having one of the worst
Rapporteurs, that I have not had received my Count.
