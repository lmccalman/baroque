Madrid, October 20, 1782.

Mr. Arredondo, Marine
Brigadier, and destined to go
with Two Ships to Constantinople
with the Presents that His Majesty
has destined for the Grand Seigneur and the
Ministers, is still likewise at
Cartagena, awaiting the Effects of the
Ministers of the Royal Battery of
St. Idelphonse which form parts of
these Presents.

The Rumor circulates that a
Moorish Army having invested Oran,
made Efforts against this Place;
having been [helement] thunderstruck by
the Cannon of its Fortifications, loaded
with Grapeshot, that one feared a
Sortie by the Number of the great
Number of Cadavers that they had not
been able to remove; awaits the same Confirmation.
