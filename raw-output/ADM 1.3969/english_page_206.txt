Paris the 22nd August 1782

The latest letters from
Madrid inform us that Don
Solano and Don Langara, formerly
Governor of Havana, have been
placed under arrest upon arriving at Cadiz.
The first who has his house for prison
returned to Europe without waiting for
the King's orders for the embarkation
of the troops, of which he could have
brought back the greater part.
The second, who has the city of Cadiz
for prison, is accused of having favored
the contraband, that the
parliamentary vessels coming from
Jamaica were conducting. It remains to be seen how
this Governor will exculpate himself from the
accusations brought on this subject
against him, by the King's men,
and Mr. Solano, and those of the whole Army,
and principally of Don Gil de Galvez,
who is said to be very displeased with him.
