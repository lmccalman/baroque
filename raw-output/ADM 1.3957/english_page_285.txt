There are in Corsica 500 [Barrelets] for the Men
who [chaulent] the [Ris]; these [Barrelets] each have
a Convoy; an Officer and some Grenadiers
were killed there; M. de Marbeuf marches
with 4000 Men to attack them and
everywhere.
     The weather has turned fair for three
days; nothing diminishes; the Misery is
even greater in certain
Provinces.
