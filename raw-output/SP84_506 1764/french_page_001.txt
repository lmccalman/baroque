Rotterdam may 1st 1764.

My Lord

It is my duty to the well prosperity of
his majesty's new dominions in North
america that prompts me to send for your
Lordship's perusal the inclosed copy of a paper
which I have reason to believe to have been after the
signing of the Preliminaries of Peace.
Altho' the time of the greatest harvest in
the reduction of Gormans troops is now past

                                                                                           this,

R.H. Earl of Sandwich.
