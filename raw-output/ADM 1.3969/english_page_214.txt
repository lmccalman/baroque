Paris le 5 Septembre 1782.

Nothing has changed the
Determination to sign the
Treaties next Wednesday, thus this
great Work will be completed that
Day.

Regarding the Treaty between the
Courts of Petersburg and Vienna, it is
claimed that these Two Courts have agreed
by Letters on their Agreement or Balance,
without drawing up a Treaty in the ordinary
form, in order to avoid any discussion
on the Subject of Titles, and of Precedence.

The Council of War for the Affair
of April 12, will take place soon, all the
Officers who will compose it, must be
arrived at L'Orient on the 20th of this Month.

Mr de Lally has lost his Trial.
