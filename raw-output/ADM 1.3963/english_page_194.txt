This Method was attempted in the
Generalities of Paris, with success
two or three Years ago, since
that Gentlemen, that one work-
ed to perfect through the Intend-
ants, one returns to it today;
They will complete recommencements,
but uselessly this time,
what is most troublesome, is
that [autel serait] court is authorized
A as to these complaints;
that the Intendants find themselves
Judges and Parties, and that the [argent],
to which alone one can have Recourse
as last Resort, is too
distant, and too frugal for
Most of the Taxpayers.

This Parliament [n'etes f'est] regulated
before taking its Vacations,
It is [mon ce l'airoit] of Capitation
increased the Capitation by Six
Deniers per Livre, but it [a prefét]
to the [Mortalitès] of [Voites].
