                    [CIRCULAR SEAL/STAMP]
                    
                                        Refineries destroyed
between Lorient and Brest, there are no [alequins]
others furnished the workers of Brittany
of armament.

They are sending from Rochefort, the 20th, that they are
arming a large Vessel, 3 [Brigsoles], and
5 other Ships, to go to Brest.
The three frigates will transport there the
sixteen Companies of Marines. He finally
told me that they were announcing at Rochefort,
that three vessels and two [Brigsoles] Indian
which are, the Jeunes, the Joli, the Duc de
la Bourdaine, the [brigsoles] should be
in need. This Armament, it is added,
is being done without Money, none has been
sent there.

The Evolution Squadron must be
commanded by the Count d'Estaing,
Lieutenant General, and Blue Ribbon.
It must in the Course of the four Months
go to Torbai, to form an
Establishment there, and raise to the depths
of our Colonies of America, after which
it will come to disarm at Brest.

                                        On.
