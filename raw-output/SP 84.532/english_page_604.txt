Extract
from a Letter from Constantinople
of April 3, 1778.

Turkish Vessels and other Ships,
departed from the Dardanelles, numbering
Fifteen, with the Design of going to
burn the Food Stores that the
Russians have established on the Island of Ipsara,
were encountered by the Admiral, who
defeated them.

We know no other Details of
this Action, except that Chevalier
Duhignote, who was the No. 2 of the Fleet
of Livorno, and who unexpectedly had
the Command of our Navigators, found
himself in this [Famille]. He then
took refuge at Chios, with three
Turkish Vessels. The Russians
pursued them up to under the Cannon
of this City, and demanded that
they deliver to them Chevalier Duhignote
as a Corsair. Upon the Refusal that
was made of it, the Russians fired upon the
City.
