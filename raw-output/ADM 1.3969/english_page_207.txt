All the public Papers do Honor
to Mr. Steffens for having vanquished a
Tranquebar for the Danes, against
the Enterprises of the Indians, but
it appears that our Court knows
nothing of all that.

There was last Sunday
a Conference between the Ambassador
of England, and the Ministers of the
United States in which it is assured
that the definitive Arrangement was
concluded, and which is to be signed.
The Ministers are waiting no more, as well
as those of the House of Bourbon,
than for the Courier from Holland. The Duke
of Manchester went to the said. Two
of the other Ministers await from it
the ultimatum of the States General,
which one believed to receive last
Sunday; and which I find still
delayed, by the Illness of the
Pensionary of one of the Principal
Provinces of Holland, so they say.
