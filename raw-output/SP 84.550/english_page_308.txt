Second.

Madrid the 5. June 1776.

Mr. Waltersdorfer

arrived at Aranjuez, I have the Duke of Alba,
had gone there himself, to attend there
the baptism of two of his daughters of War;
our Governor, Mr. de Ricardos,
Lieutenant General, also went there
even some Days, there not
necessary, that the King recommended in,
through the intermediary of France:

However our Preparations for
War only increase;
it appears that the King has determined
to listen to no Proposition
of Accommodation whatsoever,
nor enter into Negotiation, unless
Portugal L.G. has given
prior Satisfaction for
the Infraction of the treaty of Limits
in America.
