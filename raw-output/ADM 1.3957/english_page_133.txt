                          Paris the 2nd April. 1770.

                                    There has been nothing
New from our Ports and order is still
maintained whereby still nothing of the new
Projects of the Controller General, several are
spoken of, but without any Certainty of
their Existence.

     Monsieur de la Borde is in Embarrassment,
he himself thought it good to acquire the
immense Riches that he has acquired in
Twenty to 30 Years; he has had for 6 Years
the Permission to have Money struck at
Pau so freely, he has been so long free
in his operations. It has just been
remarked to him that on the Gold and Silver Pieces
struck at Pau, he forgot to have engraved
a P. an L. and a B. interlaced and the
Fleur de Lys of the King, it was found very indecent
for a Private Individual to have placed thereon his
Portrait, several Punches were given back to him
to destroy and the Director of the
Mint of Pau was informed, to know by what
Order the Name of la Borde is found on the
Pieces struck at Pau, he said no doubt
that it is by Order of M. de la Borde that he
had the Punches made, and then they are
those of la Borde, and we will settle our
Accounts with him.
