the men who having firearms have them well and for well advanced, whose formations are in such great confusion, who even have so much danger being all together, that it is not possible to arrange them in a suitable order, nor to dispose them in a manner that they can defend one another, nor even recognize each other in the melee. So that after having fought for some time with much vigor and courage, they were obliged to retreat into the city, leaving many dead and wounded on the field, and having lost the better part of their arms. Which gave the enemies the facility to advance up to the gates of the city, and to fire on the walls and on the houses, with such fury, that it seemed they wanted to overthrow and destroy the entire city. But the inhabitants having put themselves in defense, and having fired on them with their muskets and their stone-throwers, they were obliged to retreat after having lost many people.
