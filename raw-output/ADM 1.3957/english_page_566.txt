                                        Mr de Charites

     Lieutenant de Vaisseau is appointed
To command the Hirondelle which is being
armed at Brest, to carry the orders
of the Court to our Colonies.
     The Estates of Brittany will end
Tomorrow their Sessions, without having obtained
anything for the four Magistrates
detained and exiled at - Dieu de Dons
is expected to return here the 20th of this
Month.
     There is still talk of Proposals
for Peace, and much Hope is based
on them, however the
ministers do not speak of it, and perhaps
it is necessary to hide the Preliminaries.
     There are here some Printed works
which will appear, one on the 1st
Presidency, another on the Triple
Alliance, a third is ready to
announce the Paper, which will carry away
much Money. It will be more
tranquil in [Militois], there is like
that which is said which appears good.
                                        N.B.
