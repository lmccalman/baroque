Some Letters from Dieppe, and from
Dunkirk, had announced, that an
Embargo had been placed on all the
English Vessels, which were in these
Ports; we know at present, that the
motive for this Embargo, was that
the English Vessels were entering, and
were hurrying to leave, without conforming
sufficiently to the Regulations, and to
the Maritime Laws, to which it is desired
that they be subject, henceforth.
