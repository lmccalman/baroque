Dec. 1707          Richelieu 1707.


Sir

                                                                                     I
receive in the time that I took.

My response will make you know, I think, with what eagerness I hurry myself, and to what point I find it necessary to serve you usefully and truly. I beseech you, sir, not to doubt for an instant my gratitude and my attachment. It is with the eagerness of my sincere [feelings] that I have for you that I conduct myself.
