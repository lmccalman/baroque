came to me by the Seconds. M. Rhein
and this still by a Detour
of Road; which delays it still
by Two or Three Regular mails
at least, I would make them
able to [remelier]; but I do not
see how, unless she
can come with the King,
having nothing stronger at
Heart, than to give Proofs
of my zeal for their Service,
and of the respectful Attachment
with which I have the Honor to be

                                        My Lord,


                    Your very humble and
            very Obedient Servant
