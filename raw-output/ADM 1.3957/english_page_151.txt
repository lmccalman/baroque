Paris April 18, 1790.

We have received by the
Valenciennes Coach arrived at Carogne,
Letters from La Fayette le Maurière, commanding
the Forts at Forco, dated the 28th & 29th of
September 1789, by which we learn that the
Fort Beau, and theirs extraordinarily subject to the
good treatment and Courtesies shown them
by the Dutch. This Vessel departed from
Rochefort in March 1789, took 9 Months to
reach the Cape, always hindered by
contrary Winds, and lacking Provisions;
the Dutch Governor purchased some for them at
Cape Verde, where the Portuguese Governor purchased
some for them, and gave them what they
needed, they were quite astonished to
find a Sentinel at the Point of the Forts
with Kindling on the Steps, an old Dutchman
on his shoulders, with a completely rusted Rifle.

This Vessel was forced then to put in
at Brazil in the Bay of All Saints, and there they
were shown all Sorts of Civilities. The
Governor deigned to send to visit the
Vessel, by 18 Muleteers, and placed a
Guard of 18 men, they were refused
Provisions even when paying, as soon as an Officer
wished to go ashore, he was escorted by
[musillons]
