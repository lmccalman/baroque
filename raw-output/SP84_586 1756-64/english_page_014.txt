that we were obliged to send away the
sick people who presented themselves every day
in such great number that we could not
manage it. On Saturday September 12 we
assembled to name arbitrators to
settle the disputes arisen between M. Guérin
and M. Dumas regarding some lands
and meadows that they possess in common.
The arbitrators named were Messrs Verchère
and Tessier on behalf of M. Guérin, and
Messrs Bonneville and Deschamps on behalf
of M. Dumas. On Sunday 13 I said
mass in the fort chapel. There were
many people. In the afternoon
I went to see some sick people in the village.
On Monday 14 I went to see the arbitrator gentlemen
to recommend to them to settle as
soon as possible the matter with which they were charged.
On Tuesday 15 I occupied myself with different
mission affairs. On Wednesday 16
I went to say mass at the chapel of the
fort. On Thursday 17 I found myself indisposed
and I kept to my room. On Friday 18
I found myself better and I was able to attend
to my ordinary occupations.
