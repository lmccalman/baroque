Since the opening of the new tribunals
which are more commonly said to have filled
the Courts of Parliaments by the Parliament
of the Court, nothing has been done there, or advised,
the Magistrates have been let fall the fire
that they wanted to lighten, and they have all
returned the same. One was obliged
to sit every day by the Guard; some
orders were taken, and then refused.
The Palace was closed to let
pass only proper people.
Notices were posted on the Doors of the great
Chamber, and the Councillors of Bovin
appear twice daily. In a word
the new Court presents only a
spectacle of Derision for the People
who laugh at everything, and of Indignation
for those who take things
more seriously.
That is all I can give you
for lack of better; the [Cires] is violent
there remains to the King only one of the two alter-
natives, that is to exile the Chancellor
while making the [Boue Regagal] of it, and to
recall the Parliament, or else, to create
another Parliament, and not require it
