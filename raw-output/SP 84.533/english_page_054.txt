N°. 39

Paris, July 19, 1778.

The King participated with
belle-vue the hope of Midi, in the reunion of
St Denis with the Family at Madame
Louise's, which makes the good welcome of
Compiegne.

The King of Varinnes went
to see Mesdames at la Tere in Champagne.
The Chancellor went to spend this
same time at his Brother's at Provere
near Lusanches.

All the Ministers will only go after
Tomorrow to Compiegne, and the Ambassadors
Monday. The King's Farms are all here.

People speak of an important this voyage
according to the great events; but
the doubt which circulated about the Establishment
of a tower of Peers, has indeed [blessament].

There is nothing New from M. Delawarth.
He obtained Permission to bring his
[Romontbanes] Services to Compiegne
Sunday.

It is an aide of [March'au l'elst], who
supports the Bakers of Draue,
of Gray, and of Voisel.

Vro.
