Paris the 30th of June 1782.

We have received the Declaration
that the Empress of Russia made to the
Courts of Berlin, Copenhagen, and
Stockholm, as Guarantee of the
           Commitments She undertakes to advance
her Troops towards the Crimeas to take
Possession of this Province. These
Motives are, that the Porte since the Treaty
of Kainardji, by which She recognized
the Independence of the Crimeas for the future
has not ceased to contravene her
Commitments, either by making Acts
of Sovereignty in some Parts
of a Country which was not subject to Her,
or by fomenting Divisions in
the entire Crimea; that at last the
Peoples excited against their legitimate Khan,
Forcing him to flee and to resort
to the Protection of Russia which has
succeeded in restoring him. But that despite
the [Peines soufflées] and the Money that
spread the deceitful Counsel of the Porte,
to maintain the Troubles and the
arbitrary and despotic Excesses, which Russia
has not feared to exercise in a Country

that she
