Cadiz, March 18, 1788.

A French Vessel has just arrived here,
coming from the East Indies with Dispatches
for the Court of France, and Reporting
on the Capture of Trincomalee
by M. de Suffren; but that it had
cost dearly two French [ships], the Marquis
[du Puy L'Orant de sa Canone], alone
[tirate] on a shoal of Rocks,
at the Entrance of the Port. And As for the
Naval Combat, it was very deadly
on both sides.

On the 9th of the Current [month] there departed from here
Eleven French Ships of the Line,
Four Frigates, and Two Corvettes,
with 32 Transports, for Toulon.
The other Vessels and Transports
for Brest, are only awaiting
favorable Wind, to depart.
