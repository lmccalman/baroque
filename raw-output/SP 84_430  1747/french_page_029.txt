Sir—

I am in hopes that I shall have finished my
Engravings time enough to be back at Rotterdam
next friday to write to you.—

as we find nothing material in the liquored &
packettes, I begin to think that the Mexican campaigns
dances are carried on by way of Ireland as it was—
hinted in one of Carrag[?] papers which I have sent.
But this will not prevent my renewing the liquile
again at Rotterdam two post hence.
I have the honor to be
                                            Sir—
                                            your most humble
                                            & most obedient ser
Breda N° Sept 2.6                                B N O[?]
