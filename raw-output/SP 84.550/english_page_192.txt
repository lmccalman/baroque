N.° 36.

                          Paris the 29th April 1776.

                                    Our Letters from
Toulon of the 23rd of this month [l'anglement] the Duke
and the Duchess of Chartres arrived the
evening before.
    Those from Brest of the 22nd and of 24th say,
that on the 20th at 8 O'clock in the Morning, M.r du
Chaffault, commanding the Squadron,
which was sailing in the Roadstead of Isle Douëla,
had set sail, with a North East
wind very moderate, which caused the
Bretagne, and the [Sen??bre], to nearly
go onto the Coast. The next day
all the vessels had taken to the open sea,
and were [en demoare]; she was
formed by a Calm, which, having
come up, threw them onto a
Point of the Bay of [Me Bartée], where
she remained by the Calm, taking on
much Water, all the Crew is
not lost. They are occupied in
unloading her, pumping, and trying
to save her, it is hoped.
