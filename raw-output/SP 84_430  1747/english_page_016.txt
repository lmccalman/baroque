Scr

Upon an information that I have had from
some Police of a correspondence between the suspect=
=ed in England and their friends at Paris by means of
some Merchants at Rotterdam I have spoken here to Lord
Lauderdale and to his Lordships Secretary to the Ambass=
=adors this minister has promised the magistrate of
of Rotterdam his consent to our having a sight
and inspection of such letters as we have reason to
suspect.

I have by Lord Lauderdale's orders been with the
Ambassador, and I have given him the addresses of the
three merchants of Rotterdam to whom the suspected
letters were directed in the last Rebellion, the only
difficulty now remaining is that the Magistrate can
=not in a proper person to open and have the
letters, and that my opening them is attended with great
difficulty, but merely that I am very authorized etc: but
that the operation is postponed in presence of a magistrate
which makes it tedious and consequently more apt to
=ous
