[Affin d'eid] at Montpellier
the 20th of November:

The King has not gone this
Week to Choisy, as He was
supposed to, His Majesty has postponed this
trip by three Weeks, because
the Queen wishes to be part of it.

Our letters from Rome of the 28th [4bre]
say, that on the 16th of September there
will be a Consistory. That the
Cardinals named last year, will have
their Bulls continued at
the Datarians. That the Pope
knowing that many young
Ecclesiastics cannot instruct themselves
to enter into the Ecclesiastical State
for lack of titles, His Holiness has
assigned them Benefices, to
serve in place thereof.
