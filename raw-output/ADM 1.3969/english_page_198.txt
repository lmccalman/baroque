We expect Saturday or Sunday the
Response from the States General, to end
all the Difficulties that have suspended
the Signature of the Peace Treaties; but
we know that whatever it may be, France,
Spain, and the States will unite equally
with England after having received it.
          The Arrival of the Treasure from Havana
will compensate a little for the Loss of Gold,
and Silver, which have been sustained
in India, or which have passed to
America. The Islands, and the Spanish
Army, had brought a great
quantity of [Rasbres] from St. Domingue
and in some other Islands, they have
been brought successively by
our Vessels, and since Monday Evening,
the Caisse d'Escompte has had melted
seven Thousand of them, for Twelve Millions of
Livres tournois, which it has converted
into Ecus.
