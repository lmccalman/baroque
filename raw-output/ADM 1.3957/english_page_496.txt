                                                R 27. Nov. N°2.

                    Dresden the 30th November 1790.

            They are celebrating here, and I
believe that according to Derrien, that they are going to
arm the King Louis, the Dauphin,
the Magnifique, and the [bataire] to
review the place; it would be necessary that
the latter was in refit currently,
[pourcris], and that they will press it with
personnel, that the Magnifique was
very good, it was necessary to agree that it is
unfit to Serve in a new
Recasting, [nous obtenent] that which was done to it
not long ago.
            They have armed the Belle Poule for
M.rs. Saines, who was leaving the Gloire.
            M.rs. de Roquefeuille enters into [manucellement]
and speaks for next year to lead the
Minister of several different
the sword.
            We are always very quiet
for our Boats, they are not establishing
them yet, we do not even have
the [Mottiers], apparently they
judge them useless, never Part 2,
it has & which is so [dejoint]
from all.
