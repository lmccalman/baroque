who know only the impression of duty & obedience,
experience, at least silently, the pain of events, you have claimed to make
pain; you have forbidden yourself the particular usage of the Magistrate submitted
to the Sovereign's disgrace; but your sensibility does not
alter your principles, & honor, as much as fidelity
conducted you to this Tribunal, or rather you would have wished, not
[alions]. You knew that the Offices were between you
King; that the authority they had lent, & you are & that the
supplant them; you would have blushed to have extinguished them &
not been vacant; but you have filled them with submission
already that it comes from this origin. Ah! in vain therefore affection to
raise the Tribunal of opinion; against the Tribunal of
[exaltédece]. In vain [alteraçeuse]; there you cry out by the
phantom of an imaginary dishonor. You propose to your
[affertes-imputable] only a more scrupulous fidelity to fulfill your
duties, know if by force of being judges that you [impideiez-lieux]
to calumny & that you will force hatred itself to you
[achainer]; the other Parlements still even will avenge their [situs];
offended by these libels; & [quellencore], by their conduct,
the veil of fidelity, of which they have not ceased to be animated.

It is to conform to these same sentiments & render
to the King, the state, the Magistracy & our existence & what we
owe them, the usage we have not the conclusions that we
leave to the Court.
