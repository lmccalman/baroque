Whitehall 19 May 1747

286

Sir,
        I rec'd by last Post
this day morning the favour
of your Letter of the 2d Inst Viz:
        I do not in my former
think it necessary to fix the
examination of the allowance to be
made to Mr Wolters, as I
considered, I had brought his Highness
the most competent Judge
of what he might deserve
from the nature & extent
of his services, but as you
seem desirous to have my
opinion about it, I should
think, if his Royal Highness
                                likewise
