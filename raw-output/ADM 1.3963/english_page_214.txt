Praises that one haunts on the subject of the

of seeing declared the Operations
of our two Co-operators
of Finance: one still knows
nothing certain of their
Projects, except that it is decided
that there will be at first a loan
of 36. Millions in Life
Annuitants, the old ones of this
Type, will be in good Part
extinguished.
