Vienna, October 29, 1771.

                                    The Diminution of
facts in the most historians, is
an object entirely contrary to that which
characterizes Novels, where one operates
the increase in this all just, and
its published in games of lions.
    The Total Dispute of Count d'guiney
by General Drewitz, is the Only
News that we have had from
Poland; it creates everywhere a
great Sensation, and must have
Consequences; one would greatly fear the
Enterprises of this Marshal of the
Confederates, who was much dreaded.
Would he know representative the Queen
orders she, that he is given to good
body a French General, and
many Officers of this Nation.
    It is reported here, that the Turks were to
assemble in great Number at the
Danube, and one still expects before
the end of this Campaign some
News of Consequence.
