N.º 25.

Paris the 22nd March 1776

Monsieur came
last Tuesday in great Ceremony
to Paris, to hold in the Name of the King, a
Lit de Justice at the Chamber of
Accounts, to have registered there
the same Edicts of the Lit de Justice
held on the 12th at Versailles, which was
executed. The Count of Artois
did at the same Instant,
similar Ceremony at the Court of
Aids; it is a consummated Affair.
Time may teach if the Operation
is good, or bad, but
one does not see that it makes
any Sensation in Paris.
I have however found
Fermentation in the Minds,
people are fierce against the Minister
of Finances, but He has all his
Confidence
