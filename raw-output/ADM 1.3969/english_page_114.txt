Paris the 6th, June, 1782.

We are waiting at Brest, and at
Rochefort, for the Squadron of M. de Vaudreuil,
and we count that it will be able to serve
from the 20th of this Month, at the [Pr. dernier].

The latest Letters from M. le Clmnt make
mention of a Russian vessel and some frigates
to take there according to Sailors, judged
by a Council of War guilty of
High Treason. [Nullement] dragged,
considered Inhabitant of the Cape, had been
implicated in this Affair, and he must
attend the execution; when everything was
suspended, and we have written to Court to
have the King's Orders on this Subject.
It was said that Mahé in a [bazelle]
belonging to M. Clermont, that these
Sailors were going to the Enemy, bearing
Intelligence. His Friends claim
that he is incapable of such a
Crime, and that the Council of War
has been too hasty in this Affair.
Other Letters will inform us
