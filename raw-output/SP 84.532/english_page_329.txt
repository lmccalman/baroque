Geneva, March 8, 1778.

As one foresees
to say that the whirlwind of things has stopped after
in various Cabinets, I see it by the Court of
Vienna which [expeinte] Marshal Laudon, ignorant
of what one must say to his Safety.
By letters from Paris of the 2nd one learns
that the Ambassador of Vienna has received
from the Court of France, that the 24 Thousand men
that the Magistrates & Foreigners was to
furnish to the Imperial Majesty are
increased to the named 9 Thousand in the
this Sovereignty.
One claims that the Views of the Court
of Vienna are, to play at [Vieux]
of Mannheim, to place Troops, its
Instruction from the Courts of Berlin & of
Petersburg, which want the ambition
the too much agreement.
There is also some [Colès] in this Project.
Observe all the States of Empire
Germany opposed to Vienna, [clacons]
Royal which must not compress a
Power in Band.
