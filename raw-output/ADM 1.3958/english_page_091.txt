Madrid, February 5, 1725.

There is very little talk here
about the conditions of the accommodation
between this Court and that of London; it is
only said that nothing is being forgotten of what
could determine the Council that you have
even informed of this matter that we
hope to see it promptly successful
in this regard.

Mister Harris returned here
the day before yesterday, and awaits new
letters from Vienna, to resume
the Conferences with this Court.

There is much talk there about the Infant
of Austria, that everything still remains in
the same state, and that there is no order
to disarm, but only to
suspend the Continuation of works
and other War Preparations;
there is also no question of
making the troops march to their
different Garrisons.

The letter of which it is [cas] from the King
of England to that of the Plenipotentiaries
