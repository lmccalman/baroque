The troop of Callices having gathered at Cor
bera under the orders of the Marquis de Sarmento, very
dressed for the Crusaders of Marriage.

Our Laws do not permit that one pass
except with the Passport, which Cardinal
Corsini, Camerlengo, has in the name of

Portugal, which sends them elsewhere.
This crown has not engaged the Dismissal
of the troops, the Pope has deferred it
absolutely.
