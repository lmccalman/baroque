                                                    Madrid the 8th April 1715.

                            Lord Manuel, although
I [preterni] all possible Reflections,
so that our Correspondence may not
be interrupted, at least it has
not been for Lack of Zeal or
Vigilance, but inasmuch as
Circumstances furnish me with wherewith
to sustain it, for I cannot promise
beyond that. So that in the Letter
I may not be accused of Negligence
I must warn you, that all the times
that I come from different occasions, there
announce to me Daily that of
[qui vŷgne] in the Terms of the most
Recommendations in the [Rgyle] in

The Letters that I have received since my
last of the third of April from Carlos, content
to note to me, that the Letters extend
always more on the same Subject, and that
if he had not until now any Response
at all; In one he makes to me some
[Arnemens] and other Papers that they say
[hupondus], [s'iquile] there reigns now
a great tranquility.
