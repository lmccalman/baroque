Paris the 23rd March 1772.

Letters from Nork
have announced nothing New, other
than the Death of the King, the anxiety has disposed
the Queen to ask herself for
Aid as soon as at the Court, or in the City,
one has given a [seul] of being able to find
enough to maintain a Correspondence.
M. de Montequieu sends two
men, only to go as far as [vois
leurs] to Hannover. The Ministers who have
proposed the loan requested in Paris, Have
returned Saturday to Versailles for
the Response.

One does not see M. de Montequieu
very tranquil in the Position, nor
the Minister of finances, the Subsidies
and the Intrigues Are very strong at Court.

It is said that there must be two Letters
patent, one establishes the General aid
& right of [Sudseuese] between Guyenne
and the thirteen Swiss Cantons, the other
contains the same thing between
Denmark and France. It appears
that imperceptibly it is. Also
[distare] as one can for all
Europe.
