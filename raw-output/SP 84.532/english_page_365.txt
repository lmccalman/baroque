Toulon, March 30, 1778.

Mr. Becker,
as informed a Danish Vessel,
refused to Salute the Admiral's Flag
of the Place, given that our Commanders
have not forced it to do so, I inform you
Sir, alleging that through you the forts
are in forms to receive neither
to have no Difference, nor that
moreover the Order had been executed:
Mr. de Bougainton came today
to the Court.

The Commander of the Port has received
Order from V.H.P.S Ferney, to take
clarifications from the Officers
who were there the [Qumeleurs] that
Mr. de Bauret commanded;
to examine the Prisoners,
which is being done currently:
Certainly the Complaint
of the King of [Heyze], of which we have already
spoken.
