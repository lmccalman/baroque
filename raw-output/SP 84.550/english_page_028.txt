A Marshal of France must reside there
continually, with a certain
number of Lieutenant-Generals,
and Field Marshals.
I send here a continual
Circulation in these Provinces,
which will vivify them; the troops
will maintain discipline;
and the enemy will not be able to flatter
himself with any unforeseen Blow; and I in
always, to commerce, in the
fear of a Peace submitted to the
formidable it them will be will find
ready to recall all the
troops, as soon as Circumstance
requires it.
