Rotterdam the 22 December 1785.

My Lord

In obedience to your Lordship's Command, I have the Honour to send in the Inclosed to Mr Cooper the Result of my Discoveries hitherto made in the Affair of the American Trade, which if not as late & factory as I could wish it to be, will at least be a testimony of my Attention to His Majesty's Commands, and of my Zeal to execute them.

I have the Honour to be most Respectfully,

My Lord

Your Lordship's
most humble and
most Obedient Servant

Ri: Osborn.
