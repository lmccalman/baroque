Rotterdam this 26 August 1778.

My Lord,

          In today's Packet
you will find a
Bulletin from Versailles, of which
I have been offered the Communication,
once per Week, at the Price
of Ten Louis per Year; it seemed
to me to be real for this
modest Price, not to subscribe
to it at once, and I flatter
myself that Monseigneur will
approve of me, henceforth not failing to [hasper]
the Execution of augmenting and
extending the Correspondence
for this Piece. What I
regret greatly, is that
I [eme], then have this Bulletin
directly, but that it should
                                                           me


Cat of Suffolk.
