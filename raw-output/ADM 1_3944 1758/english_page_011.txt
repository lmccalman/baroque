All our Officers exalt the Maneuver
of Prince Ferdinand: he is positioned in such a Manner
as to be able to cross back over the Rhine, and to be able to engage
or avoid Combat, and it was a Matter
of Honor to beat the Hanoverians
   They write from Hanau on the 21st that the Army of
Soubise is going to march to go to Bohemia;
there are 70 Days of March, and it would arrive there
in the Month of September, to take up
winter quarters. I refer back to what
I told you in my last letter, and I am
persuaded, that in whole or in part it will descend
the Rhine to come toward the Side of Wesel to
Support the Army of Clermont.
   There is daily talk of several
Financial Operations on the [Impologies];
which denotes a great Shortage of Money.
   They lure us with the Hope of the Lifting
of the Siege of Olmütz, of a Battle in Saxony,
and of the Awakening of the Russians; but they have
So Often deceived us in this Regard, that we
Are on our Guard.
