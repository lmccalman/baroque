Private Letter

Paris, December 24, 1770.

To the Calamities
that the finances experience from the obstruction
caused by Parliamentary affairs,
to the Appearances of War, come
still to be joined violent [transfrujes]
of Court, for the Duke of Choiseul and his
[fils] are on the Point of being toppled. They
are the Dukes of Richelieu and d'Aiguillon,
the Comptroller General with the Chancellor
in troupe, and the [Sotina Saverite] who
are doing this fine work, which is regarded
today as complete.

What [entrechamps] to the large pages.
It will be [rejlouicendra] that the paid Army
has made of one of the Choiseuls the two who
prevents abbé Terray from paying
the [George] on all the Debts of the State,
and from [vivifier] the Bankers of the Court
in London and in Amsterdam. What
however to expect from him at present
that he will have [les Cendees franches]? by
the Stay we will learn many
things.
