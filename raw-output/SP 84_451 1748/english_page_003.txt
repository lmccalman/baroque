had to claim to be the owner of a
property situated in such place, and of which he
had enjoyed for several years; but he did not

repairs and expenses on the land of which he
was only able to enjoy for the time that it pleased the true

avoided by consulting the people of law, and which are
only the consequence of negligence and inconsideration.
He has therefore not acted on this occasion as
a good family father would have done. The counsel or
the art of consulting is therefore one of the qualities
that constitute the good family father in
matters of law, and even in others that have
need of enlightenment.
