I extreme before the unfortunate
of London, one doubts that the English
Ministry does what it can to
avert the war, and also acts, -
but one exercises the new
regiments, the change of
Ministry from here does not change at all
what was projected, nothing and the elevation
of the People of Family:
   The Controller General L'auerge
has taken the [grandis] of [informationnets]
in the departments of other Ministers,
the Duke of Choiseul, minister of Bureau
in those of the Company of the Indies,
the fate was to be suppressed
   It is said that the Government was thinking
of the three [Établis], that with the Marshal
d'Estrées, is given to the Marquis of
Montagneac, who is not [redu].
A Marshalship is promised
of Armentia, but the rank of
[guijon] with the Duke of Choiseul has been
done assuredly.
   The Parliament has at the Chamber of
Peers, [regnis] the Annuitants, and has
given on the future [aveneilles] of
prison in the order of the strongest plans,
                                                          which
