                                        The Letters received here by the last Post
                                        from Carthagena mention that the time
                                        was at Port Burga, consisting of the three
                                        Ships of the Line which I have already had
                                        the honor to report to Your Grace, Sir Miguel,
                                        and two Storeships, returned from thence on the
                                        15 of this Month, and that it had been
                                        fitted up with in the meaning of the following
                                        day, steering to the westward. The same
                                        Letters state that orders had just reached
                                        that Port for six Sail of the Line and two
                                        Frigates to be got ready for Sea with all
                                        possible expedition.
                                        
                                        The next recent advices from Cadiz are
                                        that Four Line of Battle Ships and some
                                        Frigates were arming there, and that two of
                                        the Ships are Third Rates    It also seems
                                        certain that there are arming at Ferrol,
                                                                                                            four
