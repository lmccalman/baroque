                        Madrid the 29th January 1770

                                    They write to me from
Cartagena of the 18th of this Month, that as on [le
Mathelin] they wanted to set Fire to the
St. Raphael, Warship of 80 Cannons,
which was to be launched to Sea shortly;
the fire took hold in earnest, and that despite
the prompt Help of the troops, this
Vessel burned until the next day.
It is now that the hull has been,
but that one can have it for nothing.
     This is the last Vessel that the
Constructor Envoys were to furnish,
and fortunately for Them, it was
delivered 18 Days ago.
     In some time I hope to
send you the new List of the
Spanish Navy.
     It is said here that the Turks made
all the English leave Smyrna,
by seizing their Goods.
