The King having named, as has already
been said, the Count of Muillebois General Director
of Engineers, of Artillery, of Provisions,
and of Fortifications, the Marshals of
France assembled regarding this latter, have
resolved that a Memoir would be made to the
King, and that the Duke of Noailles
[dependant] the last War the Count
of Muillebois would have been accused of
treason toward the Marshal of Estrées,
that [qu'on luy reprenne] the Tribunal would have
rendered at that time a Sentence,
which declared M. de Muillebois incapable
of [pas facer] in the future any Office
in the State, nor in the Militia;
that it would be necessary this Sentence the
Count of Muillebois could not be
stripped of the Positions that he had.
The King disapproved of the Action of the
Marshals of France, and said, that
as soon as he had recalled the Count of
Muillebois near his Person, and
that he found him worthy of his Confidence,
he was fully justified.
The affair remained there.
