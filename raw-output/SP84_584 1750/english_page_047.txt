Whitehall, May 29 1782

Mr Watkin,

Sir,

Having laid before the
King your Request for
leave to go to Spa for the
Recovery of your Health,
His Majesty is graciously
pleased to consent thereto.
So that you may set
out, as soon as you
shall think proper.

I am persuaded, I need
not recommend it to
you to take the necessary
Precautions for preserving
the Affairs, committed
to your Care, from
suffering any Prejudice
by your Absence.

I heartily wish, that
your Journey to Spa,
may
