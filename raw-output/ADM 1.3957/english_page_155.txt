                        Toulon the 22nd April 1770.

        His fluyt the Champagne
loaded with Cannons and Merchandise for this Port,
arrived from Rochefort yesterday; the arrangement
for the officers of the Port has been followed.
        The Council of War which must examine
30 days examine two the works of this
town the Bourgeois at the Construction. This
operation will not be easy, given the quantities
of Bandits who infest the Roads and the
woods.
        [Multiplicitation] of [honnement] to me; one wants
on the Carts of Wood at 14, the Barracks of Ch:
the Garden, and at the Enclosure.
        Beyond the Content of article 3 which are condemned,
one wants others, 4° for the affairs that one
has had to make of 4 or three Boats.

                                Paris the 22nd April 1770.

                                One thinks that it will be
[étres] question of some [étrangements] of
lodging in the Ports that several
officers of the Navy who [seutillent] since having
with the fluyt, have orders to depart. The
Letters from Brest of the 17th say formally nothing about it.
        The general Receivers of finances are
advised of the duty of thermal Oil that Bruges,
Dunkirk must commit, first
