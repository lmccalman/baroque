Brest the 18th December 1702.

The fourth Battalion
of the Regiment of Normandy received Orders
yesterday to embark on 6 ships and the
Seine, and we still do not know much
about where, because there are many plans here, but
to put on Guard to receive these
troops in two hours.

The said Battalion and afterwards will
probably receive its Orders next
Wednesday, and will only go afterwards.

The said regiment furnishes
one of the sixteen Companies that work
on the new Division of St. Vaast, [laude]
and St. Pierre [des cst] enveloped in all
the winter, as well as the [Remunation]
of Captains to make 4
Regiments from them.

Nothing will be employed to put in
condition the 20 other Companies, 10 Thousand
Workers work at Brest and Dinan the
day here.
