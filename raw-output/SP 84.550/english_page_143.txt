Paris the 5th April 1776

Mr de Malesherbes
has not released his Ordinance of
Reforms in the Royal Household,
since Mr d'Argenson said, that the
funds for his [Entour] were not
ready; thus the Affair is
suspended, but not for long.

It is very decided, that the 15th of this
Month, the companies of the Guards of the
Body, which were going to leave the
Garrisons, will come to occupy
the Hotel of the Royal Military School.

The latest Ordinance for the
Gendarmerie, will be modified
shortly; the Minister will have changed
the Uniform of all the Troops
of the King.

The Marshal Duke of Noailles has given
his resignation from his Position of Captain
of the Guards of the Body; the Duke of Ayen
his Son, will have the Survivorship;
and the Exercise.
