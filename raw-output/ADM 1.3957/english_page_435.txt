Brest the 18th October 1770.

The Movements of the
vessels have been to proceed and to maneuver at
their hours, besides the flute that goes the 8th
to go warn our Colonies, we [Liench]
quite ready the Corvettes La [Répariette] and
L'Hirondelle, for the ships however
in case the need demands it.

There is an Order to send back to the Island
of [Mettre] English [Longues] of the [Bardes]
of the Navy, which [n'a me onlut]
for this moment of wheat, it is that it is not
done currently, and that one is not
here, completely [particu] to the Island. It is
a public manner, these men
are instructed of the Spirit, it is necessary
to name ourselves engaged with the English.

We expect any day to
deal at Brest with this [designer], we
owe them the Battalion and the
Cannons of This Place.

It is still that the [Moris] toward [Diamente]
cannot [barier], and without what
has been employed, as much as gold.
