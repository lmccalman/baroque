to accelerate it; by assembling the MAGNIFICENT Council,
as soon as he can, the MAGNIFICENT COUNCIL
OF THE TWO HUNDRED.

That the COUNCIL having nothing more at heart than
to regulate its administration according to the Laws, de-
sires with the greatest ardor to see annihilated
forever any practice that would be contrary to them,
& that it will neglect nothing to lead this
important Work to a happy end; that it
hopes that its Fellow Citizens, by setting aside every-
thing that could distance us from this salutary goal; will seek only to strengthen & to pre-
serve in the State the harmony & confidence
which, after the blessing of GOD, are the
firmest support.
