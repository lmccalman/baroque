of these Ships, or some of them, touch
at the Madeiras or Azores, I beg the courtesy
known, by his Majesty's Councils at
these Places.

I have done all that I could, by procuring
the Muster of the Soldiers, names in Regts., and
their owing to Representations from me
that the body of the Admiralty have
fixed the Expedient to oblige such
Captains as go from hence, and who
require a Pass, to have a known Merchant
in London to join in the Bond, which is
executed in Consequence of the Pass
being granted.

I have the Honour to be

Sir

your most humble and
most Obedient Servant

R. Wolters
