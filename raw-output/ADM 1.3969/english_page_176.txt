The Letters from Cartagena

Of the 14th report that the Expedition under
the Orders of Don Bernardo, departed on the 22nd of the
Current month, was still in sight of this
Port, held back by contrary Winds,
and that Two Algerian
Vessels had been intercepted, which were coming
to spy.

The Letters from Ferrol of the 28th of
last month inform us that they launched
into the water the Ship St. Joseph, and
that soon they will launch another
of the same force, whose Construction
is very advanced.

They are also building in
Biscay at the Port of Pasages, and at
Cartagena, which proves that the Navy
Is the principal Object of the care of
our Ministry. It appears that we
have around thirty Ships of

the line
