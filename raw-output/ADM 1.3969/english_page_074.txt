Botany N°1

                            Paris, April 25, 1782

         Since the Signing of the
preliminaries of the Peace, nothing has
occurred in the Missions that merits
making us stop the Return before the time
The Vessels carrying to Sea the order of the
Cessation of Hostilities.  It appears that in
America the last Losses that the war
has caused are for us those of the
Frigate la Sibilla, commanded by Mr.
de Kergariou, Germana, and two Transports
of Mr. de Vaudreuil's Army. All the
English, those of the Frigates la Magicienne,
and la Pallas, the latter sank.
But in return, they have recovered
the Ardent which they believed lost.
It is expected that the War will have been more
fierce in India, and without doubt in
the Months of January, and February, there will have
been some Encounter.
It is said that Mylord Colt is dead.
Mr. d'Estaing has arrived at Court.
There is nothing New here.
