dinarily the cables of a Ship break before the living-
timber; it is more natural that a rope break, than a
piece of wood break into pieces of diameter; it is therefore necessary
that these cables be of a superior quality. The Rope-
works of Holland are good; it is from this country that
the best hemps & the best cordages come forth. Our
cables did not break during three days & three nights
of continual & prodigious efforts, they will not break yet to-
night, & in the night the wind may weaken;
finally, I said to myself, if this misfortune happens, each will want
to seek to save himself on the coast; I, quite the contrary,
will put all my efforts to move away from it. A piece of
wood can support me, for twenty-four hours, a-
gainst the force of the waves, & if it does not present a large
surface, it is possible that it will not be pushed, in spite of
me, on the rocks, during this time the wind may calm,
& I may receive help; this was my last hope.
While I was reflecting thus, the Captain of prize
came to find me alone on the poop of the Ship, to ob-
serve the means that we could employ to save
ourselves. We had to avoid seeing ourselves crushed on the rocks.
I did not communicate to him my last ideas; but seek-

a risky reasoning, became then in my own
eyes, as in his, a probability. In such
moments, the movements of the blood, & the desire to preserve
life, make one eagerly welcome all the resources that
the mind presents to us. If the cables finally fail us,
I said to him, the Ship will no longer present its poop toward the
rocks, it will come on its beam. If we do not make any
maneuvers, we will go lose ourselves on those im-
