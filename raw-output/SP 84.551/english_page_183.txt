come even the Spanish whom they
want well. None of the Generals
has any other hope than to find it, to
carry it off like Hannibal, or like Caesar,
after one has said it very vainly.
    I confess to you yet another
important fact; until the end of this
campaign, and the King, it is to
provide for the Government of upper
Limousin, and the King of Prussia himself,
should he come to establish in this
Kingdom, the ancient Constitution,
You can well guess why, but
the National spirit is already so
changed in this regard, that it appears
almost impossible; but on the contrary;
it would almost be necessary, to establish first
a project of Regency, at the head of which
would be the Duke of Sudermanie, and in
default of the first Plan, one will hold to
this last one, which one will try to execute
again this Year.
    There is no point of War between
Spain and Portugal.
