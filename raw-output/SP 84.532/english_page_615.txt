Milord

Regarding the letter with which you honored me on the 29th
of this Month, I had our Clerk write to
the Sieur Count. I take the liberty Milord of
sending you His response to satisfy him, it is
not that I wish to take an interest on his behalf, nor
support his representations, but solely
to let you be the judge of it.

If I do not receive further Orders
the matter will remain decided, that it will no longer be continued

I have the honor to be with profound Respect

                                        Milord
                                             Your very humble and
                                             very Obedient Servant
                                             M. Wolters
