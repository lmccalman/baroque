Whitehall. August 8th 1763

Sir,

You will receive herewith
inclosed a Copy of an Order in
Council, for preventing the
illicit Trade carried on at the
Isle of Man; & as it has been
represented, that Foreigners in
foreign Countries have been
concerned in this Trade, the
King has judged proper to direct
all his Ministers to give Notice,
when they reside, of his intention
in this behalf to the end that
those, who have been hitherto
concerned in this Trade, may
abstain from the future
Prosecution of it, & may have
no pretence to complain, if
they should suffer hereafter
by the execution of the Law.
It is therefore his Majesty's
Pleasure, that you should
communicate this Order
within
