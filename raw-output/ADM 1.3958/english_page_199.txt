Rotterdam 12 May 1775.

Sir

        The inclosed Intelligence came with
returns from our old Correspondent,
& from a Person who has offered
himself for Intelligence for the future
and talks much about our Interest
and Events, without having his Hearts
discovered any; and whilst makes me
have the ill Opinion of him.
However in Case he should do it sometime
or other, the Commissioners have wound
found himself a very useful Person;
and I have thought it of my Duty to
transmit to you the said Intelligence
here inclosed, that in Case it should
prove to be of Use to the Service it
might be no harm left for a Correspondent
like made to me. If having reflected
the earliest Communications of an Intelligence
of some kind to which our Office have
had the appearance of an Service to his Ma:y
I hope by my Attention to give and intitle
me the Application of that Generosity
and recommend myself to your kind flavour.

        I have the honour to be
                                                Sir
                                                        Your most humble and
                                                        most obedient Servant
D Stephens Esq:D                                J.C. Hake.
