exportation of Provisions and other things that our
would displease; his Ministers should not receive
any representations made in favour of any of
the Subjects of the Republic in point of trade.
    This has occasioned a great consternation
amongst all the merchants that trade to france.
    The copy of a letter from Middleburg will
shew you how eager the Dutch merchants are
all for tying our hands to said provisions to france,
no measures that their Sovereign can take will
cut their inclination, which they will gratify fill
they are thrown every where abroad.
    Several more persons from the Landgraviate
with his Countries have engaged to take their
passage on board the Esther and Elizabeth Dogger
Adrian Napoleons bound to Dublin.
