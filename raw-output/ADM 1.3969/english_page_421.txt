The King has just promulgated a
decree on the 16th of last month, given
at St. Ildefonso against usurers,
and bad debtors of whatever
rank and condition they may be,
without excepting anyone, not even
the grandees, ecclesiastical dignitaries
and the palace chiefs, who
mocked their creditors,
and often ruined them.

     It is claimed here that the
Venetian Squadron under the orders of Knight
Emo, has entirely filled the entrance
of the port of La Goulette, before Tunis,
having sunk to the bottom several
masonry barges.
