to the people formed to make a school of
colonels, [contrels] considerably
a King; we do not yet know what will be

[Mises la chale sous] has a Pension, of
8 Thousand Livres from the Royal treasury, he is
owed 4 Years; the Duke of Aiguillon has

The Rumor that circulated, that the Parliament
of Rennes had had burned by the hand
of the Executioner, the justificatory Discourse

only 5 Pages in 4°, rendered the 27th of July;
but this Decree gives no
Reply, a [Dénrégé] that it
would stir up in place. It was the Project of the
[foirer] Bretons against the Man in
for the élan the greatest Credit,
