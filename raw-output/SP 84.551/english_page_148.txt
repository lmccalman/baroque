Rotterdam the 13th April 1778.

Letter from a Friend.

I am going through a strange
time, regarding the Emperor. They
say that the Mama is furious with
him, it Appears that he does not want to
remarry. It
2º Appears that he has very intimately
allied himself with the King of Prussia, to whom he
revealed the Project of offensive and defensive
Alliance Treaties, which was being fabricated
in Petersburg between the Two
Empresses. Consequently, the
subjects of the Emperor were [peine est,
deprine de sortir hors des Romains]
of Hereditary Archduke, who is
currently in Vienna

All that does not have common Sense,
and could however be true.

Good
