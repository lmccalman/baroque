has done                                 which have struck us and which have given us the most
                                        pleasure and satisfaction during all this time
                                        that we have been under the guidance of god But
                                        we cannot pretend to give the detail
                                        of all the advantages and of all the goods that the
                                        lord has done us during this space of time We
                                        will only say that we have been received by all the
                                        individuals with a kindness which has made us know
                                        that god was preparing the hearts of these peoples and
                                        disposing them to receive his word. We have preached
                                        everywhere the holy gospel with all liberty and with
                                        much blessing and we have had the consolation
                                        of seeing several persons touched by the truth and
                                        determined to follow JC we have baptized
                                        several of them and we have admitted others to the
                                        holy Supper and Received Members of the church
