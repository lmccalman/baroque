Toulon the 4th of October 1775.

We are waiting here
for the Officers, and ranked officers of the First
Department of Rochefort; this Port must
always [be] a Profile of instruction, of welcome
and of provisions for the other
Ports and the Colonies; we want good Service
for those who will like it.

This general Officer, and the Staff have
set Sail the day before yesterday for l'anse du Bœuf;
and then for the Levant, where there remains only
Mr. de Vauborel, and Mr. le Grange.

I disapproved to them the Stopover that
Mr. Jones made at Cagliari, and the excuse equally
refused. Master of this Port and the Vessels
of War, unless [there is] pressing [Recueil];
it is in the Pretext of the Barbary [pirates]; but
that is much better some other motive.

Our three Vessels and two Frigates
have [Relascheut], and few Officers disembarked
observe it, we will not work from high
[Œilvré] to the two Twenty young [men] who are all
the [Chastiens], it is the Lack of Money
that stops all that.

We continue to say a Thousand good things about our
Minister; he cannot do what he wants to see;
for we do not give him the funds;
of which he has Need.

Brest.
