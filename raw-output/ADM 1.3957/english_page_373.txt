Side opposed it, on the other, the King him-

Project was magnificent, that it was a

around, and which has [efa] 20 Degrees of different
Latitude, contains only Hands
who cultivate the Soil. On the other Hand,
it was not possible that such an Establishment
would not excite the Jealousy of other commercial
Nations in India, and especially
the English.
