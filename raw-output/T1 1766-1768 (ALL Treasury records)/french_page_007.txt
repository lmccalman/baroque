As mr Renard calls upon me to give
him my assistance in his sollicitation to
succeed to his late father in the correspondence
with your office, and that I was not presumed
to hope that my recommendation of him
be of any great weight with a person to whom
I have the honour to be so little known as I
am to your honours. I will not humour call
upon me to do mr Renard all the service
