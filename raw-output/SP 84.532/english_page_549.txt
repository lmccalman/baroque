Madrid April 28, 1771

I am written from
Cartagena, that the Court has just made
an admiral charged with Galleons,
to construct in the said Port,
Six Ships of the Line of 70 to 80 Cannons!
This is a sign that they were satisfied
with the [présentés], and convinced by the
same advantages.

The News from Quito reports,
that there were Woods, that the [Cours] is
provided to have the City justified [des]
for New Spain, in the [Mexis]
of February, next; and that the
[Antonimes] and Spanish Schooners
quartered in the Environs of
this City, have the order to Re-embark
on the King's Ships, to
transport them to Barcelona.

The [Politis] both in [Garribe], and in
[Cedix], remaining always armed.
