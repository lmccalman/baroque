Rotterdam march 23d 1853

My lord Duke.

I have the honour to inform your Grace,
that Dillem is returned from London with
Clifton; it was not seen by Dillan's disinires
that they have succeeded in England or failed in
their Subscriptions; but it is hinted that in the
Austrian and German Countries above one million of
florins has been subscribed, and that three or four
of the first merchants of Antwerp are expected
here very soon to concern matters with those other
head of the Direction of the new Company, by which
I take it that Harris and Dillan are chiefly meant.
Dillan is to set out very soon for Paris, and
Clifton for Flanders in behalf of the Company.
