the last letters from Mexico
of last April 27th, report that
since the 25th of said [month] there had been 6
different Shocks of earthquake,
and that at the Departure of the Prise,
the majority of the Inhabitants, as
well as the Viceroy, were camped
outside of the City and Countryside.
The first News that one
expects from that Country, will bring us
without doubt an Account of this
Phenomenon, extremely rare
in Mexico.
P.S. At this Moment I am told,
that the Ambassador of Portugal
has just received an Extraordinary
Courier from his Court, and
that immediately He has departed
by Post, very pleased, for
St Ildephonse.
