A Trusted Friend comes without
telling me, that they will not disarm at all,
before they have disarmed in England
and that they would like to make a Convention
with the Court of London, to disarm
at the same time, that however
it was the intention here, to keep more
than twenty-sans armies than ordinarily
inasmuch as the English have increased
their [ventre] in the Mediterranean.
