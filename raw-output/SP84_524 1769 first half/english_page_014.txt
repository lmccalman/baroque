Thionnes the 30th April 1769.

There is absolutely
nothing new at Deerhergue, nor is
there at the moment any project that is
of any work.

The assurances that are given, that
there is no question of any quarrel
between England and France, have
revived the [Biffe] of the Marne, for
which Forty-Two Vessels will be
equipped.

The provision is the same as in
my last, without any appearance
of increase.


Brussels the 5th May 1769.

Everything is being prepared
for the arrival of the Emperor, who
will keep incognito; he is expected
around the 21st of this month.
