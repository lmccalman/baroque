223.

Tonnage: 10 Brigantines, Senaux, Barques,
and Gabares, up to 80 Tons,
and two others flat-bottomed.

A Letter from Pignerel of the 23rd to the King says,
that a Courier who departed from Antwerp on the 20th,
brought him the News that the English Fleet
had finally just departed with a light Wind.

If the News from Senegal which is certain, has
not caused considerable Noise in the
Company's Stocks, it is because one flatters
oneself always that we will recover Goree, it is
equally true, that the News from the great
Indies appear so pompously embellished
in our Gazette, have not produced a Rise,
as for Risle these are Returns.
There presently comes from the Dutch Cayennes and
Senegal great News.

There arrived yesterday at Court a Courier
departed from Clermont's Army on the 23rd in the Evening,
it was said yesterday in the Apartments that
there had not yet been a Battle, it is
certain that there were two Couriers in the Night from the
same Army, and there is so much Movement
at Court, that one fears that there is Harm that
they want to hide from us. There is still talk of
Disorder in this Army, and several
Generals are recalled.
