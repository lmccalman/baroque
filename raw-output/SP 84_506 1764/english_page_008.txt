Today Sunday the fifteenth of March, I went
to Mass at Moulton with all who are here in good
health, but I did not take communion there because
I deferred until Easter. After Mass we
returned to dine; after dinner I wrote
a letter to Mr Bochard de Saron and one to
Mr le Comte de Buffon. In the evening we had supper
and we went to bed early, the weather
being very bad, it rained all day.
It is also very windy today.
I gave orders to Mr Gillet to have
my hay from Moulton sold and he promised me to get
the best price from it that he can.
The night was very calm and the weather
continues to be bad. I am well
as is all the family.
