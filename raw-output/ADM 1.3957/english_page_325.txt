     To this Princess formerly we said, that there was
a Bourghdorpf of several thousand Souls within the country,
which was named [auquel], and of great number of others,
in the State Offices in the Country; and
that it is a question of a Germany between the King
the Empress Queen, and the King of Prussia. In
the principal Conditions [les avient elle disons]:
the King of Poland, and in the customs the Prince of
Salm, as of the Empress; and [oncerre] this
hereditary Crown in the House of
Saxony.     It was added, that by means of an ample
Compensation in Poland, the King of Prussia
would return Silesia; and that we shall have some
great lessons in the Netherlands.

and indiscreet Counsel of our Ambassador
in Vienna at the time of the Marriage, has personally
indisposed the Empress Queen against Us.
     The Count of Harroworth, Colonel of the 6th
Grenadiers of France, is made Colonel of a
Royal Foreign Cavalry Regiment;
vacant by the Resignation of the Marquis of
Hautefort.
     It appears therefore that the Saros have been all
