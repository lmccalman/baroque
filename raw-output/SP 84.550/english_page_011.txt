N°. 1.

Paris the 29. December 1713.

The Mayor of Rosafort,
has finally obtained for the King of Sweden
the Liberties of the Trade of the Colonies,
as he formerly had.

It is assured, that neither the Council, nor the
Parliament currently want to
admit any of the Projects of the
Minister of Finance; the Former
Claiming, in referring them back through the
[Regiés], which are being instructed, that in
the Number there were 4 against which
were these mad Projects.

There is no doubt, that this Minister
will soon leave on His own
his Office; or that he will be
dismissed.

People ordinarily speak [fattablement]
only of the laws and Ordinances that have
Appeared; they have Supporters; and
Enemies, as always happens
in similar cases.
