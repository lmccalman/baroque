to Ferrey, M. de Bellecombe and M. de la
Vadreuil, I had sent the Lieutenant
to this Island. Son of the King of England;
while requesting hastily a small Letter, he
there fell [Gastons], and Since the Prince
having the Permission to remain on Land
only 24 Hours, it was hardly possible
to give Him more elaborate Festivities.
However He did not fail to
greatly amuse him, and when one came
to the Health of the King, and to that of the King
of England, this Young Prince could not
hold back his Tears, so much was he moved
seeing Men whom one calls
at least Enemies, join with Him
And [n'oubliez] to receive him with truly
Affection, and Cordiality. The armament
having its term, very sorry not to be
able to stay longer in
the midst of a People so generous,
and so amiable, these were the
Expressions.

The Marquis de Retheny, Colonel of the
Regiment of Royal Auvergne died
at the Cape, from a Fever at the Entry.
