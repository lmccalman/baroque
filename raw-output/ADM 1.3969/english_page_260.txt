July at the earliest, that one will have been
informed of the Peace from the
Coromandel Coast.

The Discount Bank has
reimbursed these last few days many
Red Bills, and as Funds are
coming in to It at every Instant
the amount of these Bills, which one
puts at Five Millions will soon be
entirely reimbursed. These were the
effects most widespread among the
Merchants, and the Artisans, because
of their small value. The Black
Bills are scarcely anywhere but in the
large Coffers, and in the Hands of
businessmen, and rich people,
but it is not those who have taken
fright, thus all this
is going to be appeased, and the Discount Bank
will draw from it no less a good
reputation, since the Shares have
not fallen.
