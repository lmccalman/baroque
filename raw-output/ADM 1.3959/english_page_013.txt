                                                    Someone writes to me from Cadix,
that the Letters from Vera Cruz of December 2nd
bring the unfortunate News, that the
War Vessel the Castille, which [un
milliant l'ant] of the North, was [attaqué du
8.9.11] from said Port on November 30th, is
[entrun], having already on Board 8 to
900 thousand of Cochineal, but
no Silver; that the Vessel remains
out of State to be able to return, and that
the Loss of the Cochineal on Board
will be 20 to 25 percent.

According to the [lui], which from
Vera Cruz on November 29th, and the 3rd of
December it arrived at Havanna,
from where, as soon as one learns of the Loss
of the Castille, one should dispatch
to Vera Cruz 2 or 3 frigates, in order
to conduct the treasure to Havanna
to be loaded there in the [infantus]
war vessels, to transport it
to Europe.
