My Lord Duke

     Since I have had the honor to write
to your grace. I have been informed that not
only the National Dutch troops, but the
foreign troops also in his contribution are now
far preparing to be sent to Schoneven, but those
of the later that have been billiting exposed
for this Service are volunteers, and it is said
that this one man per company is to be used
above the man per company allowed before.
     The first embarkation is to be of three
hundred men, which are to form two Battellions
Major generall Sheken is to have the command
of the whole.
     I have the honor to be most respectfully
                    My Lord Duke
                         your graces
                              Most humble Servant
