Letter from the Correspondent
of Sieur Le Comte.

Paris the 21st June 1725.

When one sees the
[Indes] so swollen, that one would believe having
[voilant d'yeux], it is ordinarily
preceded by Calm. Such appears the State of
the current Position of France.
Our Kings have wisely stripped the
whole of the Electricity of Hypotheses we
can [leutres] that of which we
are threatened, everywhere in the
Provinces of Normandy, of Brittany,
and of Provence, which are the most [is
ominées]. It is necessary that some
obscure [Meurts] be practiced there,
for [j'étois] that there are Secret Orders given
on this Subject, and it is said that one has [sauvagé]
these disguised Conspirators, to [p
veiller] the government.

One [obtieneles] the [Primes] of the Blood:
whose apparent tranquility is
regarded as a forced Calm and
dormant [Gènes], one continues to [astonomer]
in all that one can.
