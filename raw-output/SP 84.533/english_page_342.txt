N° 96.

                                        Brest the 20th November 1775.

                                        Many Sailors who
had rejoiced at what had happened at the
Port of Rochefort, no longer think the same;
one sees that the Minister's plan was
to destroy the forces of the Navy are no
longer execrable, and well suits not to them
being a government.
     The rumor of [agent outre] that we had announced
from the Port, but that the King has them to raise to provide,
Corville has even the least, one has been
to order an affair [blois] of 64 [Ingelismes]
next year; But we do not believe
to be rendered [complots]. Those who have
constructed these vessels, fear
as much the Judgment, as those who have
presided a [Rayette] and employed woods
of Construction. In a King himself,
one the bad administration
sees punished, two Personages in
this Port will have great Fear.
     There is too much question of arrangements
and economy, of which the whole Corps must
feel the effects.
     One awaits Tomorrow the Promotion.
