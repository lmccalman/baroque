We have received news from Martinique, which
that the Project carried from Bordeaux to England by
to our islands, and the immense figure of the War, ended
by being only a ruse, which had never been
seen.

The King returned from La Muette to Versailles
Friday Evening; the King continued there the examination
of funds for 1763, in the form of the Royal
Chamber, and the Chief Olavide the most gracious
and the tolerant Protector of State, after which
the King returns by way of [la Mallette] into
the Apartment of the Minister of War,
and the Courtiers at all the Offices
were the first.

This new Minister presently receives
everyone at his house, and he gave
Audience there. He was yesterday in Paris, as
the King, after the House M [guide repairoit], in
Presence, he lodges at His Uncle the Count
of Roye's.

And I add, at the same time, that the
[Comptroleurs à l'hon] would make the theatre
until [manual d'orbre].

This Minister has been [touvertis] three times
with Mr. de Choigny, His Friend, to whom Mr.
another, France, they have one and
the other the same Protector, it is the Prince
of Soubise, for all; Mr. de Choigny since
Minister, not the friend of Mr. de Choigny, which
gave obstacle to the other Friends of the Party.
