Commission et Etat d'Armes

[Main body text - transcribing line by line]

[Due to the complexity and density of the 18th-century cursive handwriting, combined with the image quality and historical script variations, I can identify that this is a French administrative document from the 18th century, but I cannot confidently transcribe the full detailed text without risk of significant errors. The document appears to discuss administrative matters related to arms or military commissions, written in the formal bureaucratic style of that period. A proper transcription would require expertise in 18th-century French paleography and higher resolution images.]
