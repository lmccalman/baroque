Whitehall 20 Decr 1746

Sir,

I received the Honor of
Your Letter of the 23d Inst,
and communicated the
Contents of it, to the Earl
of Sandwich. His Lordship
in consequence of the
Intelligence therein contained
relative to the French Troops,
and to their intentions of soon
immediately repairing to the
said Contingencies of what
Establishment or the Reports
that they might take such
Measures, as they should
think proper to prevent the
bad Effect of a Rumour that
seems to have so unfavorable
a tendency. —

I am &c
Andr Philips
