Madrid, July 29, 1775.

They write to me from Cartagena,
that they would be arming the newly con-
structed Frigate there, and that it was destined to
go to the Philippine Islands; that they had
also armed 7 Zabotes, of which 4 were to
go to Cape Caux, to support
the Vessels coming from Point
Bocaïra, and the three others for the
West.

The Advices from Cadiz report, that three
Hourques of the King, loaded with Quicksilver
for Peru Chile, have set Sail from the said
Port, under the Escort of a Warship,
which will accompany them until beyond
Cape Cantin.

The Letters from Ferrol make Mention
of nothing interesting.
