Sauvigny, Return of some Theatre
Pieces.
    The Count of Athens, or the Two of
Athens, have been so assembled, until
The returns awaited much the effects
This Theatre at [cha-pré]. These Wild boars,
we this temple having no objects
except [cha-pré] of tuners to the
terrain, up to the horse races
that they proportioned themselves, some
fairs and Autumn.
    The Queen failed the day before yesterday at the
Queen, one hopes that the continuation
of time will prevent her from returning.
    The Court's Voyage to Fontainebleau
which had been insisted upon, has been newly
determined for October 5th, next
for Charly, where one will stay five Days;
The Court will not arrive until the 30th,
at Fontainebleau, and will stay there 45 Days,
unless the weather obliges one to
return sooner.
