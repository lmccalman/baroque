The affair of the sale of employments was carried
yesterday at Rotterdam, the Burgers had for several days
past been with the Magistrates and declared to them
that as they knew the Prince of Orange was not against
the thing they would stick to their points, and yesterday
morning the Townhouse was surrounded by above two
thousand of the mobb and five hundred of the better sort
of Burgers were in the very town house demanding that
this request might be granted, which act of facination every
one was so inclined to others was amazingly groundless,
and the sale of Places published upon the spot; Honours you
know on what conditions this was done, but that the
magistrates yielded to the Burgers thro' of a twelve-
month the other Towns had not resolved to do the same
thing, the amount of the sale of the places instead
of going to the Publick would be employed for the use
of the town; His old threat the Edict reads it greivis well
this day follow the example of the Edict reads of Rotterdam
