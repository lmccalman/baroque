For Parliament has recommenced [s'entroffer]
for the affair of Brittany, in that it has received
Duke and Peers appearing.

There were on Friday and Saturday, two
sessions to the Dauphine, who admirably
well made Rennes, and [Ayné] the Parliament of Brittany
sent to him, one does not yet know what they
decided on this subject, but very strong Depositions
are established, and that the Subordination of the Courts
to the Council establishes its authority. This
affair is taking great lengths.

Rennes the 20th March 1770.

Mr. de la Chalotais
refused the Resignation, saying that he
would have his office, or that the King [au vuë de Rete].

He had presented on the 16th to the Parliament of
Rennes 2 Petitions, in one he requests
to be judged, and in the other he requests his
fees. They were found very conformable to the
Dispositions that were made previously
and namely in that which regards the Duke
d'Aiguillon in Subordination of Witnesses.

The [St Caroles et Infineurs] have
presented Petitions, requesting to remain
in their Family. No response has yet
been made.
