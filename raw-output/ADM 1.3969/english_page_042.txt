M. le Tramont has left for
perpetual Prison, on the eve
he was condemned.

The Council of War is currently
occupied with the Investigation of the
Trial of M. de Vigny.

As for the Council of War which
must judge the Count de Grasse, and the
Officers of his Fleet: Of whom he believes
he should complain, people are beginning
to believe that it will not assemble
here, but in Paris, at the Royal Hotel
des Invalides and this because it will
not be composed only
of Officers of the Navy, but
also of General Officers of
the Army of the Land.


Paris.
