they sailed along the Coast; Hostile
frigate, the turtledove; which
M. le Retz commanded, finding
itself in this Area, went to position
itself between the Americans, and the
English frigate; and every
time the latter came about,
the turtledove did the same;
and thanks to this
Maneuver, the two Americans
entered St. Pierre. The Englishman
said nothing to our frigate.

     Since that time, the Tourterelle
cruises at the entrance of the Gulf, in
order to facilitate the entrance to the Port
for the Americans, who keep
us alive, for we no longer
receive from France, except where
there are many troops.
