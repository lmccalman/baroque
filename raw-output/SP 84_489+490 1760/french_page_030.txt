Prieurs of the Enemy
I was so imprudent
to transmit to You, as
soon as possible, the
important News of the
Surrender of Slondre...
& the intire Reduction
of all Canada, that I
scarce gave myself time
to congratulate You
upon this great Event.
It will be an
additional Pleasure to
you to know that
General Amherst's
Steady Conduct and
extraordinary Foresight
in combining so
extensive & difficult an
Enterprise, has gained
His Majesty's highest
Approbation.

I am Yr
                Holdernesse
