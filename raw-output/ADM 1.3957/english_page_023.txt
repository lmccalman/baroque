R 24 January 1829.

                        Pondicherry June 30, 1769.

                        Pondicherry is lost
for Commerce, the Wars have devastated everything,
all the Surroundings have been burned;
Andronegue has not discovered the iron;
that he passed from our Province to Vigo, has
killed our houses in the Islands, one has
found Whites that one puts at good Account;
Chamarilla took good day there with a man Named
Dagranette, who is renowned to them enough a
Room of the most Coquettish which has a
great Beautiful one.
        Andronegue says Workshop K. Kein,
must renounce at the foot of the Beaches of Maderas,
the Anylans have permitted him everything by their
Arbitration, and have kept nothing;
Andronegue [faisans] being the Hostages
of the Council of Maderas.
        Yesterday June 29, he has not turned out too
badly; Legrand Cheng was the [Patelet] at ta,
one has raised the Said J. Sint the Rears, and it
is necessary that some Boats of [Rix] and Provisions
arrive to us; so much is outside of
Wines; our Council does not appear moved by it at all
