Vienna the 5th January 1733.

                    For some weeks
they no longer wish to make any preparations
for war, and they speak only of an
amicable accommodation between
the Emperor and the republic of
Holland; to preserve peace
& avoid a war. They speak indeed
of some terms of accommodation
but these are only conjectures;
& probably to distract, it is that
they give to [regéaux] the orders
which are marching toward the Low
Countries, to turn back on their
steps, and to return to their homes; the
regiment of Megaski infantry
must go in garrison to Freibourg.
These other troops which are
marching, will continue their route
to the Low Countries, and must remain there.

                                                           The Elector
