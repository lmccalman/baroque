N° 22.

                                    Paris the 5th March 1773.

                                                It has been agreed at
Rochefort to have the trial, for
two Companies, of M. Danguy in, St
Domingo.

A letter from Toulon of the 2nd March says,
that on the 28th in the evening a Dutch
frigate of 40 Cannons, anchored in the Roads,
coming from Meyers, and reports that the
Merchants of this port supported and well
followed the Antwerp Squadron.

The King has ordered the [Compabilité Maison]
to have sent to the Port of Rochefort
to be employed in the Artillery outfit
in the King's War vessels.

The Comptroller General has just in his
name sent to Cette Bourgeois to the
[Toulemens], they were not presented
to the assembled Chambers, but it was said
to the King the [Boutique], this finishes thus the
last, that the King was satisfied with it,
and appears content, and that it was necessary
to wait until there was a Parliament
well established. He knows it. The Magistrates
have all withdrawn.
