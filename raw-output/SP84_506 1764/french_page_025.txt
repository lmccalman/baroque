Whitehall 23d October 1763.

Sir,

Information having
been received from Dublin
that a very considerable
Quantity of Beef to the
amount of Twenty Thousand
Barrels, has been contracted
for by order of the French
Court; and that the Barrels
are all owned by Aron
Roche; which seems to
indicate that these Stores
are destined for a very
long Voyage, I am directed
by the Earl of Egremont
to send you the earliest
Intelligence of these
particulars, in order that
You may make the most
effectual Enquiries by
                                          means
