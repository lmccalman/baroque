Petitremeu, the 11th November 1770

                                    Monsieur Bel
                                    in Geneva &c: Ruelle Gét


Sir

For a long time I had resolved to conform to your orders 
and I find myself still in the harsh necessity of not being able to execute them. Since 
that time I do nothing but agitate myself in vain to find means 
to settle, and all my efforts have only resulted in making the people who 
do not fulfill their commitments even more odious to me. I currently 
have in my portfolio for 3 to 4000 lt of commitments of which most are 
due since more than 6 months, and I cannot withdraw a sol from them. It is necessary however 
to hope that this time will pass, but in the meantime I can only beseech 
you to be willing to give me a few more moments. I know that my position 
must appear very hard for you to bear, but despite all my care and all 
my activity I cannot go faster. Receive the assurance of it and that of 
all the sentiments of respect with which I have the honor to be

                                    Sir
                                    Your very humble and
                                    very obedient servant

Mr Bel
