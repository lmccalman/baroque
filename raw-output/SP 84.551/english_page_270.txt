Extraordinary magnificence,
at Generals Romanzow and Schetlew's
jubilee gifts of 20 Thousand Ducats;
to the Gentlemen of the Grand Duke
of 12 Thousand Ducats, &c. &c.
The Grand Duke has been in Return
very little magnificent, perhaps
in order not to weaken the new
Uncle in Contribution.

The State Dispatches in the
Month of October, by which one
will perhaps be able to begin
to perceive the Political Projects
settled for No. 3, between
Augsburg and Berlin; and for
Germany between Vienna and Berlin
for I am assured, that there are
great things settled
for three Months between these
three Courts.
