N° 22. March

Paris the 10th March 1783.

People speak and concern
themselves here only about the Disaster in Sicily,
and in southern Italy. They count
more than Three Hundred Towns, Bourgs, and
Villages perished in Calabria by
the Earthquake, and all this
Country is nothing more than a Vast Desert.

The Council of War, held at
Brest, has condemned Mr. de Framont
Captain of the Jason, to perpetual
Prison, and Mr. de Villars, to be
admonished. The King has confirmed
the Judgment, and Mr. de Framont
will be conducted to the Chateau
of Ham, in Picardy.

The Council of War is currently
occupied with the Investigation
of the Trial of Mr. de Signy, formerly
Commander of the Etoile.
