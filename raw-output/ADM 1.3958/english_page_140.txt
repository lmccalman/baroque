                                        Mr. Becker, commanding a
Danish vessel, refused to salute the Admiral's
Flag and the Place, given that our Commanders
did not wish to return him Gun for Gun,
alleging that among the crowned States
there should be no Difference,
that moreover the Orders were such;
But his flag had arrived yesterday
at the Court.

This Commander of [ft h] saw Becker
[de C. Nélet-tery], to take [ches]

were at the Captain's whom Mr. [des]
Gabarel commanded, to examine
the furnaces, which is being done

the Regulation of [Becs] and [C'Héréz],
of which mention has already been made.
