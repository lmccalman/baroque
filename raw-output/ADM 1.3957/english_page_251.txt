Extract of a Letter

from St. Domingue of the 3rd May 1720.

You will know that there is that
several of the Prisoners of this Island have
been delivered to the Depot of Negroes of Rouen
& peace to the Colony. The Merchants
who had [achepteur] Indians entirely
were forced to return them to a
House, with Permission to see them and
to communicate among Themselves. Those
who had the facility to go to
their Woods, did not want to Return there,
and all made a Point of Honor
not to separate from the Rest of their
Companies; but an order was given
to them to leave the City and to
go to their Plantations.
Calm is restored, the Negroes go to
their Work, we are done with it until the
next time. Peace will therefore [pêra] us
only for the rest we are enough
all the Posts of the Colony, and will not
[serons par] provisions only good Example.
