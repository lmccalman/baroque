Memorial
to the Right Honourable
the Earl of Sandwich
upon the Brielle Office.
Rotterdam the 20th September 1769.

When I received my Commission as
Agent for His Majesty's Packet Boats at
the Brielle, my View was to transfer the Office
to Hellevoet, as that is the Port where the
Packet Boats frequent, and which indeed
is the only one fit for them.
I had chosen a Deputy, Mr Polexfen,
then Secretary of Legation, to understand that
it would be agreeable to the Office, that I
should employ Mr Gravier, Clerk of the Dutch
Post Office at the Brielle, as my Deputy.
I have not hesitated to comply with this
Desire, and as there are two Parts of Service
in which, to prevent Altercations with the
Dutch Office, it may be convenient that
both Offices combined at Mr Gravier's, South
I have chosen Mr Peter Leening his Successor
in the Dutch Post Office, as my Deputy.
Mr Leening therefore the best of Days
is such a Sharer of the Emol. as Legience one
