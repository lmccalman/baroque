the King of Prussia forced out of the Party,
but in such a way as to avoid a general War,
unless the Emperor
wants it. In this Case he could
be the Dupe of it. It is certain
that one must not expect a
forced Repression on the Part of the
Dutch.

On the other Side, it is claimed that the
Court of Prussia has declared to those
of Versailles and of Berlin, that if
the Emperor were troubled by
other Powers in His
Affair with the Dutch, They
would assist him with all Forces.
I [prrois] certain that the Two
Imperial Courts concert between themselves
all their Steps. The jealous
Powers of this Reunion appear
to do the same, and the Emperor
wants [monacée] by a general War.
