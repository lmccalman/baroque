                    I have had a Letter from a
General Officer, from the Siege of Badajoz;
By the number of 3. [Servents], for
which request to another
General Officer from here, that we
have two dead two Wounded

and absolutely deprived of
all necessaries, and good
Forages, which are the Service with
as much exactitude, as
should the enemy in aforesaid war;
but lack of some aides, Conductors,

they have, the Peace [deviras] themselves,
or some War drawn among
