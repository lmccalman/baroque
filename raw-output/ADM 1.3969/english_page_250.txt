                     Paris the 2nd October 1782,

                          The last Courier
from Russia brought, as we
had expected, the written Response
from the Cabinet of Petersburg,
to the Offer that the one
from Versailles had made to It of its Mediation, to
prevent the Rupture with the Turk.
The Empress of Russia has made a
Response less Haughty, less
impolitic, than that dictated by
Chancellor Ostermann, and which was
made to Her by word of mouth. The Empress
has given the Turk no Cause to
Complain, why would one fear
a Rupture? Crimea, the Kuban, &c,
has She not reunited to Her Empire, were
free and independent Countries, thus
all Mediation on this Subject is useless;
If ever the Empress finds Herself forced
by an unjust aggression to take

                                                    &c.
