                    Paris the 25th October 1775.

                         It is reported from Boston,
    that contrary Winds have prevented the
Deputies of the frigates armed in this Port
from [ypeter] the [Recommandances fides] of the Princes
with the King, and from paying at Philadelphia
the amount of the [avez] funds, as much as what had
been received, when a letter was hastily written there
by the Duke of Orleans, has been read the effect muddled
