Private Letter

Paris, January 26, 1791.

We are still being told
that M. Pitt renewed in these last Days
article 9, and that following the Convention between our
Court Powers and Spain favorable
to Peace, it is said that the Duke of Choiseul
still persists in Protesting about what
concerned him in the difficulties to the Duke of la
Vrilliere, he would have asked him to inform
the King about it, and to tell his Majesty, that he
was not so much an enemy as to bear witness
and that he would continue.
    Since the Return of M. de Chaugenel
we speak in Questions on the Subject of
[Daygogne], although we foresee that this must
principally be the fault of an Intrigue of
the Spanish Embassy in London, the
secretary of the Parliaments put there the courage
to imitate by the Sovereigns that were made
to touch on this Ministry, as [Meuvrot]
and Hurt by this Confidence, there are
Politicians who venture to
judge the Epochs of the state, they claim
that M. Pitt was in the necessity of
working on Strengthening the
Peace, wanting to rise to War
to make it more agreeable, and make a
Diversion
