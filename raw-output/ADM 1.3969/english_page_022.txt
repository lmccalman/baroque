Mr. del Campos, after having fulfilled
his Commission in London, will depart for
Philadelphia, as Minister Plenipotentiary
of the King, to the United States. He will depart
from here with Mr Garoque, Merchant from
Bilbao, very intelligent, but one does not
know with what Character, this Merchant
will accompany him.

                You will not delay much in seeing
depart an Admiral's Ship for
all our Colonies, in which one
announces in advance, that the importation
of all foreign Merchandise
will be Subject to paying exorbitant
Duties, to Support and
advantage all our interior Manufactures,
which will occasion without
Doubt many Complaints,
and much Contraband, 
France not being more spared
than all the other Nations.
