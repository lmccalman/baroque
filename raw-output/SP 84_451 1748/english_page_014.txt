1749 M.J Duvot                                                                    20

I have received Sir the letter that you did me
the honor of writing to me regarding Abbé
Barthelemy, with the packet that you had enclosed with it. The
praises that you are willing to give him are credentials that add
much value to it. The Reputation of the R.me inspires in you the confidence that the work
in hand could only be good; If I can be useful in any way, I
beg you to be persuaded that I will do so with much pleasure. It is with all the
consideration that I can have that I am with a perfect attach-
ment the very humble and very obedient
Servant. Durand.


Paris June 1749
