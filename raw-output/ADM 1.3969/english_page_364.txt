Paris the 11th June 1784.

It is reported from Strasbourg
that one of the large chests which has been opened
with the greatest success, if the others
succeed well, we will have then founded
in the monarchy, the most beautiful moral
and the most sure that one can follow.

It appears that the disgrace of
Mr de Graef is certain. Messieurs de
Broquiende, Charles d'Epénouse,
Renaud d'Allems, and de Ballès, are
admonished. Mr de Creuillon, suspended
for three months, Mr de Oavel, out
of turn. The Sailors of Mr de Graef
and generally all the other captains
discharged from the accusation.

Monsieur le Marquis and Comte de Vaudreuil,
d'Alborg, de Pierre, de Marbigne, d'Olhavy,
and Charles, discharged, and their conduct
praised.
