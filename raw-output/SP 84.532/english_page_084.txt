the Enemy Cabal, they believed, that this was
what had excited the fury of Mary Queen
of England, and persuaded against the Catholics,
the Aversion of the two New Kingdoms
to the Mahon Islands, which have caused to build
to the Catholic Majesty, that she in the state
come to avenge her, & to repel the [Pèle-

claimed to have there, and as a result of that
the Certainty of those who have raised and will have my
absolute pacification since the Moment
of the Fall. The Defenders on the contrary
claim that it is to Them that we owe the
tranquility which begins to be reborn
Important Good, and that it is no longer

by their care that the evil has ceased. Which
would not be to enter into the particular History
of the treason that is reproached to them.

As for the Duke of Bouillon, it is a
Victory which was indeed at the end of the

not to his Envoy, whom he had delivered
several times, & which not having been
granted to him, should have made him presume
that the Services were not as agreeable
but to the asylum, sort of Permission which
always announces a lasting one.
