St. Il Mans an 1


Genoa the 2nd February 1781.

The Constructions in
our Shipyards continue with
the greatest Activity, and
the supply for our Constructions
is so great, that the Wood ran short.
To provide for it, Mr. Cabral de
St. Ildems set about to
purchase all the old Vessels that he
could find, both at our place,
and in our Neighborhood, he
purchased 28 of them cheaply, he
had five of them put into Pieces,
From which he is currently having constructed
Two Frigates of 26 Cannons
each, which will be completed
by the middle of the Current Month and
which he has already sold to the
Americans.
