a new and very circumstantial Report
of the French Navy, which, as Your
Grace will observe by the Advices
transmitted by me, is very far
from augmenting, as it has been
reported from different Parts.

The distressed State of the French
finances, and the Uncertainty of
the different Methods that have
hitherto been thought of to redress
them, is confirmed by different
private Advices.

It will ever be a great Satisfaction
to me to receive Your Grace's Commands
and to have an Opportunity of giving
Proofs of my Ready Zeal for His
Majesty's Service.

I have the Honour to be
most Respectfully
My Lord Duke
Your Grace's
most humble and
most Obedient Servant
R Wotton
