Dunkirk the 4th September 1782

The King's Barges which
have to load Soldiers and
Construction Wood, arrived
here on the 3rd of this Month; our Officers who
accompanied these Vessels say
that they found at Seige, near
Two Thousand Vessels, the greater
Number English. These Barges have
departed for Brest.

There is nothing on the Shipyards
here, except a Dutch Merchant
Vessel, which has been by our Coasts.

One speaks to me here only of Troops
that should be landed on the side of
Germany. One also claims that
France has sent Agents
(Announcers in Turkey)
