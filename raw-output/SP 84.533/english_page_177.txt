Price as the Cavalry Regiments and in
France. He will be able when he has
orders from the Empress to procure for the

The Corps of Gendarmerie will be preserved
to provide a Detachment in Service
to the Nobility, but the entire
Corps will be recast, so that it may be always

At the head of each Corps there will be honorarily
a Senator in Campaign, but he
has a Letter of Service, which gives him

were in Vienna, he sent them back to
Rome, and one regards that a [Chaire], a
a [Palais de Chambre] offers him, and another
official Domestic. He has taken
the Route of Livonia, but one does not know
nothing is known of it. There was talk of considerable Deputy
to Venice to Rome.
