It is said the Department of Mr.
de Malesherbes is separated, Mr. Bertin
will have the Detail of the Court, and of
Paris, Mr. Amelot will be Secretary
of State; they detach a Part
of the Provinces, to give to
Mr. de Vergennes.

Many People say, that Mr.
de Malesherbes will not leave
the Court, and that he will remain to be
one of the Principal Counselors
of the King. Whatever may be said of it, this
Minister, known as such a perfect
honest Man, is generally
regretted, people are grieved at his Retirement.
