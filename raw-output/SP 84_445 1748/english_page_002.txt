My Lord Duke—

It is by his grace the Duke of Newcastle's orders that I have the honour to direct to your grace a Duplicate of the Advices which I had to me done all Humours—

A Placard suspending the execution of the three placards published last year in relation to the french Trade was Issued here last wednesday; and it is expected that a Proclamation was also Issued over in france about repealing or Abolishing the laws against the Dutch: but it does not yet seem certain that france will restore the Regulations of Trade of 1739.—

The Duke Reps will now be at liberty to navigate to the Ports of france great quantities of Wheat and other corn are already bought up all—

His Grace the Duke of Bedford—
