Private Letter

Paris, April 15, 1793.

So there finally is
a mister Parliament of England, and the Court
of Mines Suppressed. I will not give you
a detailed account, because all that will appear
in the Gazettes.

Several new Works appear,
of which the most interesting is a Reform of
the System of Despotism, which they seek
to accredit; there are some for all Types
of mind, and for all Species of
Readers; amusing and Serious ones;
Learned and Superficial ones; and the
heads of the different Councils were to
send [Ballets] of them, to
communicate them to their partisans in
the Provinces. The two important ones,
which I ask you to verify, nothing new
has yet reached there about which I
am of the opinion of Pelet, and the Column
The Key to the Enigma of the five superior
Councils, can only be deposited
at Boulogne by Sea, which it was necessary
to establish without formal Rule.
