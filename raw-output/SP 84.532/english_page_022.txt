He is charged in Consequence with
500,000 livres of Annuities in favor of
Count Dubourg, and 50,000 in favor
of Mr. de Chamonis, besides First
valet de chambre; and some
other Pensions as well.

Of the 28th. December

The Bomb has exploded, and the
Disgrace of the Choiseuls is complete.
It is difficult to say in the
first moments the Effect that
this unexpected event will
produce. It is certain that the Parlement will
not laugh about it, and that the Duke is not
at all for the violent Measures
that have been employed. If the Duke
de Diguillon has Part in the celebrated Bureau
of yesterday, for he is not
[nublement] loved, little favor
would turn us away.
He has none if he profits from
still discovering the Destination
of what is being embarked at Brest, at

Havre.
