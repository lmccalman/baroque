Brussels the 7th February 1793

                    It was believed that the Prince
of Kahrenberg will soon justify the day of
Vienna, in that it is to fill
the Committee of [Cuerinte], which is thinking of
retiring.
            There have been no news since my last
about the Health of the Empress
which makes one believe that Things are
not so fortunate, it is that Her Royal
Highness dined yesterday at the Count of
Kurtaing's, where She said that the Emperor
would serve the [C.R.Jeary], & no unforeseen
Event puts an obstacle to it.
