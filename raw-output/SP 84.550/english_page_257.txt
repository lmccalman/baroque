Madrid May 10, 1776.

There has been seen a letter
from a General officer, written at
Malaga on the 21st for the frontier, in the B.
current [month], by which he requests
another General Officer from here,
that our Vessels hold all
the Islands of War well
munitioned, and abundantly
provided with all the necessary,
and with good Garrisons, who perform
the Service with as much Exactness,
as before the Enemy in open
War, with their advanced Grand Guards,
Beaters and Patrols, &c.
And likewise, as they have been
themselves, or some
other Civil, among them, at the arrival
of 3. [Enviconnement], all the Kingdom
being divided into Military [districts].
