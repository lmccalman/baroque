it would be important to know if all these good people of the surroundings
are devoted to him, and if they would be ready to defend him, and to support him in
his bad intentions. I have heard said that there were some restless
spirits who went to see him, and who made him believe many
things. I do not know if that is true, but I believe that it would be good
to be informed of it, so that one could take one's measures in consequence.
The King was very pleased with the manner in which you conducted yourself
in this affair, and His Majesty ordered me to express to you
his satisfaction. He hopes that you will continue to watch with the
same care over all that will pass in the country, and that he will always
be informed of what could interest his service.

I learned with pleasure that you had taken measures to have
arrested those who had committed disorders in the recent troubles.
It is important to make an example, in order to contain the turbulent
spirits, and to prevent them from carrying themselves to new violences.
I hope that you will take care to have the trial instructed with exactitude,
and that justice will be rendered with all suitable severity.
I recommend to you again to neglect nothing to maintain good
order and tranquility in the country. You can count that the King
will support you in all the measures that you believe necessary
for this effect, and that you will always have his protection in the exercise
of your functions.
