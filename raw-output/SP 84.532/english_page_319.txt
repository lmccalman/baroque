Private Letter

Paris, March 5, 1775.

                    It appears that the
Princes and the Peers, - in their Memorials
to the King's Ministers, have requested the
Duport recall, by which they represent themselves
united with the old Parliament, as the Sole
unique and true Court of Peers;
and the abolition of what they call the
new Parliaments, and the change of the
taxes of cities - and of the Countryside which have
in nothing. It is claimed that this Writing of the
signed by five Princes of the Blood, and by
[dateurs] Peers, was [envellé] to the King by
the Marshal Duke de Biron, and that the
Royalty is very indignant about it. - The
Parliament of Paris has rendered itself
[serré tant] in their Deliberations.
However, they cannot
have them registered by the King from 1 to S. [Suard],
to withdraw it from the City, and what near to
reprimand, as long as the Majesty of the [Cours-
sion] of known it is, and will have [reffiés]
and Declared.
     Several People of Quality have received
these last days an anonymous circular
letter.
