Rotterdam this 26th April 1776

Sir

I have had the honor of
communicating to you at the time that Madame
Perrier Correspondent from Vienna had
been put in Prison in Vienna on the
accusations of Letters written
by which he [Emontre] that Liberty,
but that all that she had has been
confiscated, and that she has been forbidden
from ever reappearing in the States
of Austria, representing to me
The Misery, I found myself, [Je Je]
could employ her some other
Court, to Procure her Bread, [Je]
that [Je Je] flattered myself with the support, that in
the meantime [Je] would send her a
[Doueur], to Pull her from The Misery
where he [Je] finds himself at this moment, [Je] without
doubt [Je Jans] the air. I pray you
Sir, to let me know The Good
Pleasure of My Leid Jussetberg on this

Subject,

Monsieur Engel
