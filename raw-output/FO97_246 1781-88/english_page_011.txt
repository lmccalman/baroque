Rotterdam le 28 July 1788.

My Lord,

As the chief Point of the Correspondence
is to be informed of what passes in the Parts,
I am happy in the Succès of my Endeavours
to procure Intelligence from thence.
If they are of no great Importance at
present, times and Circumstances may
render them so, as they have been formerly.
I wish that I may always have it in
my Power to give Proofs of my Zeal
for the Service.

I have the Honour to be most Respectfully,

My Lord,

Your Lordship's
most humbled and
most Obedient Servant
L.D. Slake.

Marquis of Carmarthen     234
