Rotterdam x 4.19.62

Sir-

I have no letter from Paris, to day, and
each post day increases my uneasiness; and
yet I can not well think of taking any new
measures till I have an answer to the last
letter yesterday which I may expect re-
towards the close of this month.

The enclosed Payment for Geneveve Lemery -
[?] last Wednesday.

I have the honour to be with great truth
Sir -
                    your most humble
                    and most obedient servant
                    R.W.Horry

Mr Mr Williams
Wymhove Sqrt
