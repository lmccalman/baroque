                           Paris the 3rd February 1770:

                                        The Minister of

Finance is working at this time on these
finances and will incessantly make a great
State of the Council investment of,
    the repose of all the States, the Monks will
not be forgotten, all the Professors of
Offices whatsoever will be included in
the Reductions, several will be reduced
to alms for Those, but especially the
Church people and are vigorously struck in
the public opinion of the Council with the
Ordinances.
    I know certain that all these Reductions
will produce a sum less than what the
King will have less to pay.
    The Controller General has on the table
Paris with the Ministers on the Reforms
made in their Department. One sees
in all that the Secret of the Duke of Choiseul
prevails, and one should not have expected to
see in [sourd] C'Attila terrny, Bernier,
Ministers and Cardinal.
    The King is moreover obstinate about a
great Transaction at the Court, the Parliament
has brought Remonstrances against the affectation
                                                           of the
