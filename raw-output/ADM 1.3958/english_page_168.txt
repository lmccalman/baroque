                                        Paris the 18th April 1775.

                        We live and other mayors

[anennes] Young Ladies of our Doors without my hearing it,

it is because there is nothing to report.

        Presently we shall do so, without one

knowing well from what source it comes.

        The Young Lady of la Rocherne of Avignon does not

conform.

        The King did not go Sunday to la Muette, she

remains until now separated. He has ordered

[mandes] at la Muette, from which one believes that the King has

determined them to do what he judges appropriate

for the good of the matter.

        The King has finally appointed Mr Chomart

Councilor of State for the Navy, it is Mr Bourgeois

de Boynes, Councilor of State.

        The list of Benefices has been given

at the same time to the said Archbishop of

Reims, Grand Almoner of France, he

is very rich, he has thereby, we have been told, the

Bishops to someone whoever it may be of the

posts of this list, which is in bad order

and much in arrears. One does not give the permission

to stop you at the Bishop of Orleans and

his posts, to make them render Account.

        One does not yet say more clearly

that there will be a Parlement of more ancient

the Duke of Choiseul, and Mr de La Vrillière

one will choose from them, who are [décennes] the

Bishops equally that one makes enter in depot,

without any the Empire.
