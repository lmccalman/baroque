Since [Rigultes] hours they have been removing here
and in our Surroundings all the Vagabonds
and People without Avowal; and they have had them
dispatched, to make general Levies
throughout all the Kingdoms,

that the Port should be attacked, and
with all our Forces; but it
appears that they prefer to avoid
a general War.

The first News that is
expected from Buenos Ayres, will reveal
the [sonnet] or [mdire visée tte] of the
Portuguese Minister, besides veiled
of Peace, or of War.
