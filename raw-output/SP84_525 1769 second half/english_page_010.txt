Pondicherry, March 5, 1769.

Our unfortunate
Colony did not expect so recently at the
end of last Year, a Plan from the Court
to work on our Fortifications
definitively, nor the Plan that the Company
had given, which gave occasion to Mr.
Boyé to hand me, which is [l'an
est] of Mr. le Posme and Chief of Engineers; we
set the Mayor to work at the Beginning
of December 1768, a few Days after
the Arrival of the Battalion from Mazulipatam,
[l'Ateur] of the Minister's orders, with
Col. and St. Mauriste.

It is Mr. de Bournet the younger who
leads the Work, and can make up for the
four Years that were allowed to pass
without doing anything, we have demolished the
Bastion of Wasringam, as well as that of
Madras, and the Walls of the Bastion of Arjon
from the West Gate [en Cles de
Desprez], and our battalion which is
not numerous, in Battery, with [Marché Pied],
with our own hands their Pantalons; This
Bastion and Blicams no longer make two Months.
