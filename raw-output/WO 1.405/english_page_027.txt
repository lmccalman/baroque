& Henry. The Spanish Squadron I mentioned had been
          joined by six Frigates - I was surprised to
          hear that the Eighth Captain from Helle-
          ville said he could not distinguish their nation
          added that as far as he could judge by
          his eye, he should have taken them for
          Spaniards, and he is a person long used to
          the Mediterranean.

          Orders arrived about the 8th of April or later
          for the immediate armament of fourteen Ships
          of the line. They were to be manned if necessary
          by the registered Seamen of other departments.

At Hotspots     Some late letters from Madrid say that
20 Apr. (5th May)    little hopes of the love between Frigates are
          ordered to be got ready but no motive is assigned
          for this measure.

          fleet of twelve Ships of the line from
          Carthagena; which it is said are going to
          Cadiz
