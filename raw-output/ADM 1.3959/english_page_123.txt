the 25 Dec. N°21

                    Genoa the 1st September 1772.

                    They have drawn from O Eno
two [Porgues], of those that are
constructed on the Ponant Coast;
one of 2500, the other of 2800,
and the other of 2500 Barrels approximately,
and belong to two Merchants
of this City. They are working to
finish the others.

     The Artillery Contractors have
supplied to one of them the Cannons
from Spain, they will not fail to
fulfill exactly the Orders that
could come to them.

     However I doubt strongly there, that
they will come from that Side, for, I know
all the Appearances. Spain
does not seek War for the
present; I believe rather that she
will have her eye on some
Commission from the North.

     The public Gazettes will
announce to you the Damages, and the
                                           Misfortunes,
