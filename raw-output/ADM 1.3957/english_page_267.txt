All the [eur] and we were right in Paris
from Marly to Versailles; one has much
until present this voyage, but there is not
enough as in the last years, of
[propres] alas. The King will go stay at the
Tours at Choisy for hunting, at [Clermerai],
the 30th. Will go sleep at La Muette, and will
depart the 31st for Compiègne.

The Royal Family will see in passing
Madame the Duchess of St Denis; this Princess
will take the Habit of Religious in the Month
of September.

Madame the Dauphine has been to the
hunt with the King the 3rd; She shoots very well
a shot of [Fulerie].
