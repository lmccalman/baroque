all the Edicts; but only those printed,
distributed to the Citizens & Burghers & to the Inhabitants,
of Edicts of the same quality: therefore, but only,
by the Sovereign, without examination, without approbation,
adding to finish all at once, & by virtue of
this law, the abbreviation by this way of speaking,
that it is derogated to all the
the other ancient Edicts; anterior or abrogated, & he
did not declare them null, & made no form of
mention of this new Edict; although the people
he did not contradict them: this
of a new sanction; they remained therefore entire
[tiers], in henceforth, & in all their force: they
the right to the Citizens to avail themselves of them, to apply them
& preferring them once to compare them. How
the Citizens & Burghers of Geneva,
Began
in 1707 to make the slightest claim the three Edicts;
after it Council,
had been broken & intimidated; the Small Council
will have acted by
juridical [vites] without bounds, behold, that it understood its
votes of rigor, the executions & the punishments, & by the
all these manners rigor the art of
reunite all that to have
the Citizens to silence. The Small Council well marked of
well marked of this power, in having suppressed in that
the Edict of 1712 what declaration was to it, in that of
1707; one knows enough in what manner the rights of
[paisent] in Council: & since that time Council did it: the Small
Council gave new proofs of this power;
of the thundering Decree launched against the anonymous Letters
manner in which
1718; against its Author; its adherents, & their
the accomplices,
posterity; & finally that the most authentic of its
power, was the famous to establish its authority in 1714,
claim on the part of the Citizens; & Without the consent of the
General: [Enforcé] that one can say with truth,
that it does not remain of the elections, & until the epoch of
1714; the Small Council has [jour] of an entire sovereignty
in the State; it it was not juridical nor legal,
equal; it was nonetheless real. From which one can
conclude, that no law abrogated it is, to oppose
the strongest barriers; to stop the abuses of
authority, which does not cease to undertake, & which, following
a celebrated Author, seeks only to extend itself still more
these barriers will be vain & useless; if one
gives arms to authority to them by force: For
little by little put into tool; & the faces with the words that one
establish; this is what one makes understood enough; in re-

being able not to recognize Edicts not observed; or
by supposing the necessity of
tearing them, & by supposing rebels cor-
rupted to the Laws; to make valid with them the principles
elevated against
ancient to the Edicts; & by the sure means of
ancient; it is a sure means of establishing Aristocracy;
exists little & insensibly one attracts that also necessary of
some, & patience, & one profits from all the
circumstances, & one seizes
with time of all circumstances;
omission & all occasions; & the disposition of the people;
so appropriately the veils & discretion: & the disposition
it is not established clearly to what one can arrive.
Edicts as
ancient to have the laws nor not sole Laws of the State, nor
& printed that of the most essential; the Citizens of Geneva or Burghers
ancient the most titled; & [Fond] can have the Magistrate
ignore what until recognizing the ancient Edicts;
only to the & the not force; & the Small Council drew profit,
conform to that of 1568; to sustain the original manuscripts;
designs of the ancient & possesses the the ancient & those of
the species in
finance, & where founds the Republic; which founded the base
Edicts that that one has established the difference of
base which founded & the foundation of the ancient
of the Constitution of the Councils, & which have fixed the rights
powers in & the bounds of the State: to Edicts
& attributions of the different Orders recalled &
one comes to Law sovereign fundamental;
finally from which the other by that of 1738. And where the Council drew-
& conducted by
necessarily & and of few of these ancient Edicts: It
of them is authorities
was simply & that of 1568, which it is only a
similar that it simple not make of the decisions Edicts: It has
collection on the order observed in the elections in the
manner of proceeding there: & on the exercise of offices;
as its preamble states: It speaks well of the
power of the Syndics; & of the anterior police of the
Small Council; but it makes no mention of the authority
& of the rights of the diverse Councils, although it
names them: it therefore imposes these rights & this authority
established by preceding Edicts; which then became
to be as. Page 75 of the Political Edict refers
well to the ancient Edicts not printed; anterior to
that of 1568, when it says, that Messieurs the Syndics
are established by the Edicts to receive the propositions that regard the public good &c.

In effect, the liberties, franchises, privileges, immunities,
customs & usages of Geneva, which draw their
origin from Charlemagne, were drafted into public act
in 1387, by Adam Livers, Bishop of Geneva,
who fixed the authority of the Syndics, & the manner
