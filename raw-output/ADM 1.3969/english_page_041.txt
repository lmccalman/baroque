R. 4. Cté. No 2

Brest the 28th March 1788.

They have just dispatched
for Deningue, Three Luggers, which
have orders to give Chase, and to destroy
some Pirates, who are cruising to Windward
of the Cape, and who seize all the
Vessels which go there for the purpose of trading
in English, and they pursue them toward
the small Islands of Canada Bahama;
if it is impossible for the large Boats
to pursue them.

Despite the Squadron which is expected here
from [la Cale], and which is almost entirely
composed of Three Deck Vessels
they do not fail to put to Sea,
those whose Construction was advanced,
and the Temeraire, is among this number.

It appears that the object of the Court is
to have constantly in this Port as
in that of Toulon, 18 or 20 Warships
in condition to set sail within days after
the order to arm them has been given.
