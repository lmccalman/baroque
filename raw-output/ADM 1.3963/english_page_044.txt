                    Madrid the [ce] January 1718.

                                        Our latest
        News from Cadiz announces
        the Departure of the Regiments of
        Roussillon, of artillery, for
1st     Porto-Rico, and that of Spain,
        to the Canaries, for Havana,
        to change the respective
        Garrisons.
                    Our Reports from Alicante of the 18th Current
        state, that the two Brigades,
        under the Command of [Mtis]
        de Lascida, destined on a Cruise
        against the Barbary Pirates, had
        been obliged to take refuge in
        this Bay, on Account of heavy weather;
        but as they had
        many Sick on Board,
        they would have been permitted preferentially
        to come Ashore.
