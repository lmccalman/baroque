It is said today that the Court of Turin
is on very good terms with that of Florence;
that the Courts of Versailles and of
Madrid strongly press His Majesty
Sweden, to enter into a
Negotiation, in favor of the Infante
Don Philippe, whom one wishes to place
on the throne of Corsica, by making
him King of this Island; but that
[s'éloignement] appears there still
distant.
