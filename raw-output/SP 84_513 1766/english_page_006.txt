This pleasure, however necessary it
may have been, is construed by Some
as an invidious Prohibition of their
expressing publickly their love for
their Stadtholder.

    I have the Honour to be
most Respectfully
        My Lord Duke

            Your Grace's
                most humble and
                most Obedient Servant.
                    R. Wolters,
