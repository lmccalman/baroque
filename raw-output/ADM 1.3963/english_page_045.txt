A Letter from Barcelona of the 13th of
this Month, reports among other things, that
judging by certain Preparations
being made there, without determined Object,
and the Quantities of Privileges
that are expected there from Naples, Sicily,
and Sardinia, one must believe that one
has in view some other Expedition
for next Spring;
which however does not
appear probable, for we are
hardly in a state to
undertake anything.
