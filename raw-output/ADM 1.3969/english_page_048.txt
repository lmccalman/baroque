the Division of Brest, to return to

On the 12th of the Current month, Mr. de La Mothe
Piquet, had not set Sail again.

On the 6th July last, after the Battle
between Mr. de Suffren and Admiral Hughes,
the Former withdrew to Gondelouze, where

Suffren arrived at Trincomalee,
and on the 30th it capitulated. On the 23rd the Fort
of Ostenburg agreed to the Capitulation.
