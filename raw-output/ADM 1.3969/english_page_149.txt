Madrid the 22nd June 1783.

We learn from Mahon that
a certain Ludlam had disembarked there
presenting himself as Envoy of Bay
in the Absence of Mr. Versailles, seeking
permission to proceed to the Court, but
that it not be so, everyone appears to
believe that our projected Expedition, and
held ready, will not take place; all the
better, as one flatters oneself that all will be smoothed over
at the arrival of Mr. de Ricé, who is en
Route, today our Friend and Ally.
The Ambassador of France, is going to
leave us to return to
France. He has by his influence, rendered
to all Foreign Commerce in
general in Spain an essential Service,
because he had negotiated and accelerated
the formalities, that were established from the
first Instant of the Peace, and in
which France was more mistreated
than the others; especially, for all
Fashion Merchandise, whose Duties
were at an exorbitant Price, on
which all has been modified: [fetant] complained
one supposes that this tariff will not take place.
