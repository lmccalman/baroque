One can guess, from this trait, that all the Letters of Madame
de Sévigné have not reached us. It is believed that she
wrote to the King to request the Regiment of Grignan
for her son, and to obtain the survivorship of the Office of
Lieutenant General of Provence, for himself. Some
people claim that it was to Monsieur de Louvois
that she addressed herself. Nothing positive is known
in this regard. It only appears that she would have willingly
sacrificed the pleasures of her daughter's Society, for the
advantages that her family could derive from her stay
in Provence.

Be that as it may, Monsieur de Grignan obtained, for his
son, the Regiment that was requested for him, and he was assured
himself of the survivorship of his Office. These two favors
decided him to remain in his Province; and Madame de
Grignan remained there with him. Madame de Sévigné,
who had formed the plan to spend several years
at les Rochers, to restore her affairs, found herself obliged
to renounce the hope of seeing her daughter again; and she had the
sorrow of thinking that it was still necessary to wait several
years before being able to reunite with her.
