These last days there arrived
here a certain Spaniard, who was
supposed to be here for his pleasure; but it
turns out that this individual made
a sale here nor at the River of
Ponant, and at Savona, and that he
bought several ships, both
large and small. Upon his return
he went to the Consul of his
Nation, and two hours later he
took the post for Milan; after
having stayed there three days, he went
to Turin, where he stayed five days.
It is conjectured here that Spain
is having these purchases made, to use
them against Algiers.

The fleet of [Doute Guisseaux]
at Toulon is ready to depart at
the first order from the Court. Construction
continues there with activity.

Great demand from the state of Cairo.
