Rotterdam 3 August 1778.

Sir,

Not finding in the Church and
City Register, the Name of the Secretary
to the Navy Board, I am obliged to be
troublesome with the inclosed Bills of
Lading, for the Log of Fir which you
desired me to consign to that Board,
according to your Orders. I likewise
inclose here the Account of Charges
on the said Logs, amounting to
£79. 2. 8 Sterling.

Befides what I have said already
upon this Subj. I take the liberty
1st That the wood upon which this is to be
charged, must be thoroughly dry.
2d The wood must be well covered with Tilt,
and in Proportion to its Thickness,

William Fraser Esqr.
