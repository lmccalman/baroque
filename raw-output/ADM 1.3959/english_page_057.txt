N° 12 April 1772

Paris the 3rd April 1772.

The letters from our
countries have added nothing to what was
said at the last ordinary.
The Parliament registered Monday
last the Declaration of the King.
The Ambassador of Spain has by
this sent a courier to Madrid
to go give account of it to the King.
It is said that [l'Emine] is well informed
of this Declaration, and that surely
the Revocation must result from it.
It is said that the Object of the Declaration
is that the Pope have the money, and nothing
that he could not have it surely.
The Parliament persists always in
what has truly provoked the deprecation:
thus things, instead of being arranged,
become entangled with the court of Rome.
The Spirit, and the Party of the Sorbonne
still reigns in this Court, the
Ministers who govern, as much to
the [Cleyque], the Party is very powerful at
Versailles, the women assist it, and Rome
the Principles hold much to it.
