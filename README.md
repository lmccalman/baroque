# Baroque

This is a project to take pdf and jpeg scans of 18th century french handwritten journals, OCR and translate them into English suitable for use in academic historical research.

The OCR and translation are done by calls to Anthropic's Claude models via the API interface. The results are compiled into LaTeX books.

TODO in the future: enable RAG-like functionality.
