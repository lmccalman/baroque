All the Detachments of the
Officers of the Marine guards,
of the Soldiers and of the Sailors Are
made, We received the order the last
Ordinary to reinforce all the
General Staffs: thus several
officers who were counting on
resting this Summer, have been obliged
to arm if there is War.

It is believed the destination of
our Vessels changed, what is
Certain, is that as soon as the
Troops arrived, it was
claimed to fear or it is feared
that the English might not come
in force to dispute our departure.

M. de Macnamarra still has
the gout, the Officers of destination
that are expected here, have not yet
arrived, If one had foreseen the
War, one would not have armed our
largest Vessels in the Manner
that they Are, it is perhaps On
this that the English speak loudly.
