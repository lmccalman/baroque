27 Dec. 1790 & detach     My reason for the men takinge the (L.D.C.) from
                          Martinique rather that matters then begin
                          to wear a suspicious aspect. Colo Cabrera was
                          in arms, the French & Spaniards with some of the
                          male inhabitants had left St Peters, carrying
                          the lands, a Proclamation had been issued by
                          the Intrigantes that all such who should not
                          return in Sixty hours should be deprived of the
                          Rights of Capaskes. This promises to corroborate
                          the Code of Negroes now so completely armed, &
                          nominally expecting to be attacked, by the Spaniards
                          at the head of the Mulattos, but in whole force
                          I neither of only about 800 men.

Mr. Merry                 The Spaniards think at Barcelona has been
4 Apr. 1791 & detach      obliged to fly. His Frigatts was left here Squaw
                          from dirty, otherwise I made my also very
                          last departur, and it is also said that the
                          whole was to proceed to the lands that is
                          soon as the Wind should allow them to put to
                          Sea.
                          Upon this' the Ships repeated to be fitted out
                          for immediate Service at Cadiz to assist of
