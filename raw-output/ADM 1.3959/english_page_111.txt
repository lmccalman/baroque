            Toulon the 5th October 1772.

                [SEAL/STAMP]    I have the honor to report that
Sal has been replaced by M. Durband to
command the Marine Schools
and everyone has approved this choice.
    The two Chebeeks which served
for the fair at Beaucaire, have
returned, and been disarmed.
    There is talk of arming 2 frigates
and a Chebeck for the Levant; but
the orders have not yet been given.
    According to the latest Letters from
Malta, the Grand Master was at death's
door. It was said that the Bailiff
of Limenes had great Hope
for this Position.
