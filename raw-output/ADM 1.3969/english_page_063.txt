Paris the 11th April 1782

Our Fleets have Sailed to
Cadiz more than Two Thousand Seamen from there,
and despite that, the Squadron from Brest, they
disembarked a fairly good Number
upon its Arrival. The Stay on Land and a
better Nourishment, will restore
very quickly all these Seamen. This last
European Campaign without being as
deadly as the First, has not
failed to carry off many People;
and among the Officers, finally, one
counts Seven Ship Lieutenants,
who died of Illness.

For some Days, they have spread
worrying Rumors About
Mr de Vaudreuil's Squadron, but one
hopes that this Fleet will not have [Sutte de Perte Belle];
to fight, because it would await there the Reinforcements from
Spain, and that in the meantime, one will have
Been Informed of the Preliminaries of Peace.
