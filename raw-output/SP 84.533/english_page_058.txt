Madrid the 4th July 1773.

They write to me from Ferrol
that two Warships must
set Sail for Buenos Aires, to
bring back to Spain the troops that had
been transported there, and that they were also
preparing at Cadiz some Vessels to
send them to other Places in America
for the same Purpose.

From [la thagine] they inform me, that they
were working hard there to form the
fortifications, which until now
were only of earth, and that thirty
Xebecs coming from Barcelona,
had entered there with the Crew
for the Galliots that they were going
to arm to go to Barbary.

The Letters from Cadix say the arrangement,
that the Cavalry which was lodged in this
Vicinity, has begun to march into
the interior of the Country, having consumed all
the provisions and Fodder that had been
gathered for it.
