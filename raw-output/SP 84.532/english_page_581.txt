Rotterdam the 21 May 1771

Milord

Since May The Quarter of the Correspondent of the
Day Count Woronzoff Began the last letter
of which expired, I took the liberty Of writing to You
& to let me Know the sooner the better, to avoid
any Dispute with this man, Your resolution, Whether he
Must be Continued another Quarter, or Not.
If he were in a state to discover a part Of the [Scins],
With which he attracts Your Nobility to This man to
Preserve, He who could Become [blidé] Of Correspondent;
but it is for You Milord To Judge Of the Conduct
and Whether it is Appropriate To continue him still, to have
More Certain proofs about his [Suisvir faire];
there may be Circumstances, which can
put at Fault the most skilled; and I am willing
To admit to You Milord, that I cannot yet form
any Decisive Judgment On This correspondent.
Awaiting Therefore Your Orders on his Subject;
I have the honour to say myself with profound Respect

Milord

Your very humble and very
Obedient Servant
M. Wolters.
