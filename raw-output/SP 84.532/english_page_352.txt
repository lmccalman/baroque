Couriers have been dispatched to everyone, to carry
the King's Orders to all the new Councils of the
Provinces which are going to be put into operation, because
the fate that one there.

A famous and fatal Decree was received here yesterday,
long from the Parliament of Toulouse against
the Establishment of the Superior Councils,
and defends the execution of the Decrees rendered
at hour within the King, before the things that treat
the said Councils there have been established & rendered
Legitimate by the Edict of Creation that one attests registered
by a Parliament.

This Parliament sent one of its Officers
to Paris to deliver its Decree & to all the
Princes & Peers; which was executed the day before yesterday,
yesterday, but the Portal did not want to permit him
to hear it, he only held his Decree.

The Comb and the Seals has fallen, they have taken from him
the list of Benefices, to send it to that
tion of these Benefices in the Ministry.

This is today a Doctrine of the Duke of
Choiseuil, it has been a long time since the Portal
would have desired to see the list of benefices removed
from the Keeper of the Seals & that the Kings could not
truly dispose of a Bishop choice
in the nomination of Benefices, & it is now
publicly as thought the Chancellor & the Church.

It is well that the Baron of Breteuil has been sent
to Vienna; the Equipages however are
not to be found ready.
