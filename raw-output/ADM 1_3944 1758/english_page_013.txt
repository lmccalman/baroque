at Louisbourg the 3rd June 1758.

     The Ecko arrived here on the 29th in the Evening,
and la Bizarre and l'Intheuse the next day: The
same Day M. du Chaffault, commanding the
Division of Rochefort, anchored at Port Dauphin
in the Bay of St. Anne, where he disembarked the
Regiment de Cambis which comes by Land here,
and l'Ariheuse arrived today, and the Rest
Tomorrow and after Duham.
     An express Order was sent to M. du
Chaffault, to proceed here, he could have entered
immediately if he had attempted it, because the Ten
Enemy Vessels which were cruising before the
Port, were too much Downwind.
     Also the Enemy has anchored in the Bay
of Gabarus to the Number of 560 Sails, among
which it is said there are 18 Warships,
of which 3 with three Decks, the Rest transport
Vessels.
     It is expected they will begin their
Landing today, we have very
good Entrenchments there.
