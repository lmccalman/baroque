Rotterdam 27 December 1773.

Sir

The Mail from France arrived
this Day, but not having left us the usual
Packett from our Chief Paris Correspondent,
I imagine nothing worse of it than
that either he has not been well enough
to write by it, or that his Letter
has been put somewhere into a wrong
Bag, and flatter myself the D'imier
desires it brought by, or that by the
next Mail I shall hear Something
from him, or him of that ago.

Mean time I send the Supplement owes
for the No. of the Gazette which set down
in France, in Case of any
Miscairies, or failure of the former.

In the Packet you will find the Leyden
Gazette of the 26 and with which the
Supplement to the Letters comes hither
only be married.

I have the honour to be with Respect Sir

Sir

Your most humble and
most obedient Servant

P. Hake.

Governor Bay D
