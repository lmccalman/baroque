Province & Instructions,
You will not uncover those
You have formerly written.
The Parliament must
Yesterday pursuant to
what the Law has
prescribed in Case of a
Demise; and there is
no doubt but the two
Houses will give the
earliest Proofs of their
Zeal & Affection for His
Majesty's Person and
Government.
You are, upon this
Occasion, to put Your-
-self into the strictest
Mourning, which
charge will be allowed
You in Your next
Bill of Extraordinaris.
I am &c
Holdernesse
