Sunday 29 May St Etienne

Honored Gentlemen

For three months now with the arrival from Orleans. They seek to make us return by means of police. I think that we must defend ourselves well against it & remain free. The seizure of goods & expropriation & all other hostilities to prevent us from giving ourselves a manner, & nothing is done to bring back. It is also & above all necessary to obtain justice, & to review one's rights to the goods the advances that in our position we would have. In well being cannot suffice that it not be employed with in the measures of the police of the hospital or of the house of commerce that a whole or less to authorize this. In the Towns, or the Bureaus of Manufactures where one can occupy oneself in the Villages or the farms it is also necessary to obtain occupation & permission to remain there. Submit these observations & give me some news of the means, of the resolutions that can be taken in this country. I must shortly receive some notice & some response. Can I return if in the moment.

Receive
