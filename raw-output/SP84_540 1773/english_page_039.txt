Constantinople May 8, 1770.

The Affairs of the 4 temporary
Divans will end Saturday. They had
[humoit] recalled the Reis Effendi to
present for the Russians. His Excellency had brought
with him a Convoy of 2 from Constantinople minister;
but it appears that his plans have been changed
since the Divan of yesterday Thursday and within an hour,
[Monseign[eu]r] the Russians; she departed for
Scutari with the intention of attacking that
Place, or marching to Candia.

I think that the Reis will bring all his
maritime forces against Candia, and upon
arriving in the port, to retake this
north outside the [Coorg]; and the Russians
do That.

The [Comité Coloni] has united all the forces
of That, as much as he Could attempt some
Expedition, but he is not believed to be in a state
to make an Enterprise.

[La Barine] had requested Ten Thousand men
from the Tartars, for and as is said, to employ them
against the Russians: she requests [à il], the troops
of that Power, which sees in it a challenge
of Independence from the Porte. This Reverse cannot
reassure her enemies: a March would be very necessary
and before [?] in the properties to the
Grand Signor to inform him of it.
