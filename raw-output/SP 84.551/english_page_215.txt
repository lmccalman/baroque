Mr de Malesherbes, Minister of State,
has left incognito, and without retinue,
under another Name; to go
travel in Holland, where he plans
to stay two Months, from there he will leave
for England.

The Marshal de Richelieu has just
won a Lawsuit in Parliament
regarding confiscated Bills, which some
Merchants claimed to hold from the
Marshal, while he commanded
the King's troops in Genoa, has been
declared null. It appears to be a
Prelude, to do the same
with those who are today the
great Lawsuit against Madame de
St Vincent. This Affair appears
to be slowing down, in some time
Parliament will enter Recess
following Custom.
