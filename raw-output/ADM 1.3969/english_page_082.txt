Paris le 4. May 1782.

The Duke of Manchester,
Ambassador of the King of England,
arrived here last Thursday.

The Count of Adhémar, took leave
of the King eight days ago. He must have
left from here for Brussels where he has
some affairs to arrange before
going to London.

Mr. de Markoff, Minister
Plenipotentiary of Russia, has not
yet been able to be presented to the King,
because of an Indisposition that prevents
the Prince of Khevenhuller from going out.

There is nothing new at
the Court: many Rumors are being
circulated, for lack of News, which
contradict themselves a moment after they have
been spread.
