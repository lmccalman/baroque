Everyone expects that, upon the arrival
of several Millions of Piastres
from our Americas.

Our National Bank
proceeds rapidly, and there is much
eagerness to place Funds
there, and the Directors accept
this as much Paper-money,
as ready Money, because
by Paper they pay
Four per Cent, thus one
flatters oneself that very soon, the Three
Hundred Millions of Reals, initial
Funds of the Bank, will be
filled.
