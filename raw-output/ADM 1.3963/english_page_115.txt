Paris the 3rd June 1776.

Our Letters from Paris
have announced nothing more than the
previous ones.

The famous Military Code which you have
been awaiting for a long time, finally appears
printed, and yesterday M. Le n..., has no more than
the work for the Printing of the Law
of the King's House to do, and the
Gendarmerie to reform; it is
hoped today, that it cannot
subsist as it is at present.

The Office of Intendant of
finances of M. Amelot, is given
to M. des Puyols, intendant Intendant of the
Province of Bourdelle, and that of
Provinces of War, to M.
Amelot, Son. [Ce on cumulera]
the Artillery and the 25th May, last
[Se] is only 38, they are going to make him
pass into different Branches
of the Magistrature.
