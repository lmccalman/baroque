Madrid the 19th January 1784.

The Count d'Aranda
makes frequent small Trips
to the Court, so long that he
has not returned to his Embassy
in Paris.

The Two Relatives of the King of
Morocco, who had come here to
compliment His Majesty on the
Birth of Two twin Infants,
departed from here yesterday for
Cartagena, where They are going to embark
for Constantinople: on the Two
Vessels of the King, which are found
ready there with the magnificent Presents
that His Majesty sends to the Grand
Seigneur, and to his Ministers, under the
Orders of Mr. D'Arostegui,
Squadron Commander.
