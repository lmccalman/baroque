Paris this 9 February 1790.

The Letters from our Kings
announce nothing New.
The Parliament assembled Tuesday, gave
Reading of the Remonstrances on the Recruitments
of the Regttes, the King's Men were charged
to go Learn from His Majesty the Day and hour
that he will want to receive them. It is not believed that
for form, and that nothing will change the
Plans of the Court.
One Expects at any Moment to see appear
Decrees, and this Week still there have appeared
Two, one which cuts off the two per Cent
of the Capitation of the Officers of all Classes
of the walled Towns of the Kingdom; the other which
orders the Balance of two Tenths in place
of that of Amortization of the Benefits
of the General Farms, and of an entire Tenth
on the Small Casual Farms rents &c.
There are even people who fear that in
the General Farms these Gentlemen want
to quit, and ask to cancel their Lease.
Two Tenths on their Lease, and two Tenths
On the Salaries of all the Employees,
will produce a considerable Sum.

                                                           On
