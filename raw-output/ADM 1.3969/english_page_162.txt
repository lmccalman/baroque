N. 28 fa 29

Paris, July 18, 1782.

                    The letters from Cadiz of the

25th recently received report that on the 20th
there entered into the Bay a French
warship, departed from Cap Saint-
Domingue on May 4th. It was learned from
this vessel that Don de Borges had
set sail from the Cap on the 27th [Srmés] to
bring back to Havana all the
flags and the Spanish troops.

It is reported from Malaga that a
vessel, departed from the Cap on May 28th,
had just arrived there, that the news from
this Colony [reported] the Squadron and the Convoy of
General de Borges at 20 leagues from Havana,
and that Don Joseph Solano was awaiting him
to bring back to Europe the troops
with the treasure with which he is entrusted.
This does not accord with the reports
that had already been received at the [Clist], that
this Squadron had left Havana
on May 9th last.
