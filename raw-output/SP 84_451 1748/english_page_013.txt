[?] always very inclined toward you and very persuaded                                  August 1774
that in employing you he would serve the Province well. Whatever difficulties
circumstances may have brought to the conclusion of this matter, the confidence
of M the Duke of Croy has not weakened. He has asked me to assure
your Excellency of this several times; and to ask him again, if I knew
whether you still wished to take charge of the intendance of Hainaut. You
were kind enough to respond to me affirmatively. I wrote immediately
to M the Duke of Croy, who replied to me that he would inform the Council
of State concerning this province. Your Excellency judges that he could not go
about the business otherwise, and that it was not possible to solicit at Court
a position for you without your having wished it. It appeared to me that from the Council
of State the matter had been referred to the Department. That is the natural
course; and M. the Duke of Croy having had the return from the Department, wrote to me
that he hoped that things would end to the satisfaction of Y. E. and that upon his
affirmative response, it would be his pleasure to inform him soon of news
more positive. I have received no further news from him, but I expect to receive it
soon, and to be in a position to inform Your Excellency of it.
