Rotterdam the 5th July, 1748.

My Lord,

I have the Honour to inform
Your Lordship, that at last I have got a
new Correspondent in France, whose
Situation in fact, as to be able to give
Satisfaction, I have had much trouble
to bring him to the Point, and to make him
enter into my Views, however he has now
promised to serve me, and in his Letters
to me of the 20th Janu, he tells me that he is
promised a good Correspondent at Toulon,
and that he shall use his best Endeavours
with regard to Brest, &c. I hope the
will soon give me a Proof of his
Attention, by his Consequence of the
Instructions given by Sir James Harris,
I shall transmit to Your Lordship only such
Intelligences as shall be worth your
Notice.
