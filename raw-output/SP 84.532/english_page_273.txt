Mr Webber

Madam,

I have received Your
letter of the 28th Ult., and having
laid Your humble Request before
the King, I have the Pleasure
to acquaint You, that His
Majesty has been graciously
pleased to grant it, & You are
accordingly to take upon
Yourself (with the Assistance
of Mr Blake) the Care and
Management of the Stores
& Merchandize carried on by
the late Mr Webber, in which
I doubt not of Your constant Care
and Attention. His Majesty
is pleased also to grant You the
same Quarterly Allowances of
£50 as was made to Your
late Husband for that Service,
& the same Salary of £45 p
Quarter for Your Clerk, which
Sums You will accordingly
charge in Your Quarterly Bills.
