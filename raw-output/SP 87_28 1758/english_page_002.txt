Hague May 15th 1750

My Lord

I had the honor in my last to
acquaint your Lordship with my arrival
at Helvoetsluys. Where hearing Mr Wellens
was then at Rotterdam, in order to save
time, I made that my way to the Hague.
Instead of Mr Wellens, agreeable to your
Lordships Commands, which approach I had
made in the purchase of Provisions for the
use of the King's Army, who informed
me that Contracts could not be made
here in any reasonable time, nor by any
means in a secret manner, nor was it
practicable to get them from the State,
and that he had writ to Prince
Ferdinand to acquaint him with it,
He further added that a Person from
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick was

The Earl of Holdernefs
