            They are informed, that
Mr. Baudreuilet arrived on the 19th April
at Cap St Domingue and that he
departed from there on the 6th May consequently he can
arrive at Brest, around the 20th or 25th of this
Month.

            We are also informed of the Death
of M. de la Grandiere, young officer
commanding the Blanche, he distinguished himself
in the two last
Campaigns. He died of a fever.

            Some Letters from Marseille
have given to understand, that the Vessels
which remained armed at Cadiz, would
be charged with an Expedition which would
have for object, the Bombardment
of Algiers, but our Politicians
believe nothing of it. We know that Mr de
Crodorat, and Mr O'Reilly, have been summoned
to the Court of Spain, but we believe
for all other Reasons than This
Project of a Bombardment.
