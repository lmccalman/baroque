Madrid, November 15, 1788.

One reports from La Coruña
of the 4th of the current month, that the
frigate la Diligence had just entered
this port, having departed from Montevideo
on September 6th last, with 600,000 strong
piastres for the King, and much money and
effects for private individuals.

We are informed here
that the Venetian squadron, under the orders
of Chevalier Emo, arrived at Tunis
since October 1st, having presented itself at
la Goulette to negotiate peace with
this regency, had not been able to conclude
anything immediately that it departed, leaving a
warship and a xebec
before la Goulette; that there were two
English frigates making prisoners the
Venetians seeking them five cannon
shots, one presumes because of the inspection.
