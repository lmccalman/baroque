Memorandum of Accounts
at M. May's

Il Cora

[Main text body - right side]
The Consequence of this affair is that M. Duret has sold
to M. May twelve thousand livres worth of merchandise, which
he paid half in cash and half at three months term,
and that M. Duret has remitted to M. May a letter of exchange
of six thousand livres on M. Bosc of Lyon payable at three
months from date. M. May has accepted this letter of exchange
which he must pay on the 15th of next month. M. Duret
presently requests from M. May the payment of this
letter of exchange, because he needs money to do
honor to his engagements. M. May refuses to pay
this letter of exchange before maturity, because he says
that he has no ready money, and that he is counting on
the payment from M. Bosc to discharge this letter of
exchange. M. Duret insists on being paid immediately,
and threatens M. May to have it protested if he does not pay.
M. May asks M. Duret to give him
a few days delay to procure the money
necessary for the payment of this letter of exchange.
