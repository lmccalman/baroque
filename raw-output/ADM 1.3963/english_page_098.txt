The Intendance of the Indies and Isles of
France, the King has newly charged
with this Intendance, Mr. Rigoles, and Bogny,
whom one should henceforth forget.

The Count of Bogné, Lieutenant-
General, is named, it is said, to
command in Provence, in the Place
of the late count of Rochehouart.

It is assured, that the Limits in the Isle
of St. Domingue are finally settled
between us and Spain, and that they
are very advantageous to us, in that
they extend our Dominion
over neutral Parts, which were
in dispute, and would have remained in
the Hands of the Spaniards, by default;
but from which, on the contrary, the Activity
and Industry of our Colonists will draw the
greatest Profit, with Care, and
time. Thus the Marquis
of Vaudreuil acquires a Fine conclusion
to his Mission, of which he has known, it is claimed,
to negotiate all the Parts with the
Two Powers.
