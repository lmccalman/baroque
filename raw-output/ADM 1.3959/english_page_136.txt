H.210.4.7.N°1

                                        Genoa the 10th October 1772.

                    To give you
Proofs of my Zeal to be
useful to you, I made myself the head of it to serve
a Correspondent in London.
The Person to whom I wrote
marked to me in his response that he will
communicate to me as soon as he has
knowledge of it the details of [débitendus] to the
inhabitants. He wants [egistemment]
for my the interior; and he will take up
the Correspondence, but he will not
write to me, except when there will be
something that merits my
Attention.

For the rest of this side, that one
is working in the Low Country Scotland
on the [emmenagement] of 26 [Ouisijambes]
of War; [qu'ecrivert] the [funde]
to 18 other Vessels of the Port of
[Mort]. Nothing certain is known
about the destination of this Squadron,
but if he [appread] something,
he will inform me of it.
                                                                                                      V.F.
