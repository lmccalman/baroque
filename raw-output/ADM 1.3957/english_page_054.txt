Brussels, February 5, 1710.

     On the 24th of this month we learned
of the peace between Portugal and the Duke of Vienna,
through the great Progress being made upon
the Volunteers of Turkey, it is presumed
that the Emperor will not remain neutral there.
     On the other hand the King of Prussia
converses with Foreign Ministers,
with [aveux dits], that he was not seeking
War, but that if he were forced to it, he
would be found fully ready.
     The reports received from Prussia, always indicate
a good Understanding between
the Emperor and this Prince [la bête], and the
Deputies and Envoys who are here of the
between the Czarina and the King of Prussia,
also give [avis élement l'Connnoitres]
that the two Courts are on good terms together.
     I begin only with the [avis forte],
of the Reduction of Mons, and if one
[forme de son exécrable même Dessein],
that this be only the [Pelade] of other
Operations.
     It is affirmed that Duke Charles will depart
soon for Vienna.
