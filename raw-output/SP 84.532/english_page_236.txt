The Act of Council transfers all these forms
precious. It annihilates "a Body tied to the Crown by the Monarchy; a Body born with it; a
" Body; to which, says Pasquier, our Kings owe
" four times more than to all the other political Orders;
" & that each and every time that by opinions
" [courrianes]; they [démoirent] from the facts or
" such & remonstrances of their [montrees]; by such
" times would they lose much of the foundation &c&c
" ancient of their majesty, being their support [illé-]
" with this Company. It is this same Body
that a Judgment of your Council annihilates without preparation, without judged forfeiture. The penalty prescribed in the infamous Edict that was the day of the
reclamation was applied to it, & the Council that pronounced this Judgment, is the same one that drafted or said it drafted the Edict, that joined its presence to that of the Parliament of
Paris assembled at the Lit de Justice, & which, alone &
at the will that makes it move, alone now pretends
apparent sessions to fill today the void
of the Parliament that it has proscribed.

How many abuses at once, Sire! There is one that alone erases
all Citizens, because it shakes all
properties.

If the offenses, the irregularities, the confiscations or

Your Chancellor, Sire, has worked against himself
years, by encouraging the confederation alone-also

" The Chancellor de l'Hôpital, ready at the point to Catherine

There are no more irremovable Offices nor Officer of the
Crown: from the Execution of the Edict can draw a simple
command to remove the most immutable privileges. The Law henceforth powerless to put
in-doers in-faith can share only blind submission.

At the sight of this shaking of all rights;
one cannot doubt the project to overturn the Monarchical constitution.

It is for the Nation, Sire, to resort with respect
