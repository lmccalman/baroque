conducted; where it is impossible to hope for the salvation of a single
man; we do not know, in truth, from which side
the front of the Ship will turn; but, from both sides, I per-
ceive some hope. To the left, the shore, although
bordered by pointed rocks, presents some sands, & if the
Ship turns thus, it will be necessary, immediately, to put
four men at the helm, & hoist a sail. The
stronger the wind, the more it will sustain us. A route of
twenty fathoms suffices us; the force of the waves & the wind,
will make us pass over the rocks, which appear at the water's
surface, & the greater part of us will be able to save
ourselves. If the Ship turns to the right, the same maneuver
can make us double the point of the largest rock,
& we will go break ourselves toward the harbor wall (*);
there remains for us still, in this case, some hope of salvation.

   I confess, Sieur Gibb overwhelmed me with courtesies;
he came to see me the same evening in the tavern,
where I had been conducted, & spared me the next day the
hoorays, with which I have been since amply regaled; he

was constructed only for Fishermen's boats; Ships can
anchor only in front of the rocks, & I have been assured that be-
