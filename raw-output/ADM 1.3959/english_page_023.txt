the 21st march

                    Toulon the 4th March 1773.
                         [SEAL]
                                        Sir,

     He has arrived with the commission of Lieutenant
General, and the Salary of Chief
of Cavalry. The Treasury of Royal Treasury is
withdrawn also with 800 Livres of Pension
Upon the Royal treasury.

     The new ordinance will occasion
many Retirements, as much in the State
as in the ranks.

     The [Commande] has been most terrible,
nothing serves when it concerns money above all.

     They want to withdraw [Recelibles] from us,
by changing the Uniform; those
who dominate the Arts, have without doubt
the Purse well filled.

     They are going to arm at Marseille, at
Rochelle, to go balance themselves in the
Islands, and in other [poles] only;
God Knows what will have happened at the next
letter from Monsieur de Laurane by His [Sonde]
by M. de Lemonniere.
