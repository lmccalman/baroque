Regist. N°2

                        Paris the 11th December 1770.

                                    Mr. the Duke of
Choiseul having been exiled to Chanteloup by order
of the King, the 24th of this month, I hastened to
correspond with Mr. the Ambassador
of France, and to send him the certain news.
The Parliament did not go to Versailles
this year as has been said, it only went there
last year. The Court obtained the forced
registration of the lits de Justice, which came to
an end [à l'aisée] of the rather strong protests
made by the various parlements of Justice
and which were in conformity with that of Paris, taken in
its lit de Justice of December 13, 1770, all
the Parlements of France having more or less the same
spirit which is contrary to the Prince, but that of
Paris expressed with more heat what all
the others thought.

I believe that this affair could have
consequences, for the spirit of Parliament is always the same, and
one cannot prevent the King from taking measures
against them, but one does not yet know what
they will be.

The Prince of Condé and the Prince of
Conti did not leave the Court, they
remained there despite the solicitations of their friends, who
begged them to withdraw as had been done
in other times.
