106.

The Princes of the Blood, and the Peers have been
united for a moment with the King, but the plan
which has already expressed the impression that should
make the Decrees of Parliament which were judged
impossible. The Committee of the Chamber
not all judged.

[Rég] has drafted, it is said, some remonstrances
against those of [Lartine], Louis XVI will be
neither dismissed, nor informed of any exposition,
nor [Péquence], as much Paris in the suite or
Palais-royal, is the greatest [Maujoire]
that we have, honest, polite, just
and virtuous.

The ferment increases more and
more in the good King and Paris beat
this effervescence and find that the
Letters of the King had at least slight
and the Men of the decrees to all that
since one is not yet. All that is
done, it passes, is only the execution
name Decree of registration, y also
[convenit] after the Cardinal de Rohan
The documents which should emerge, and
which suffer in their profits say
on the contrary, that the Princes of the blood have
broken the execution: but it is that they have not
[rienlement] succeeded, it takes iron
and Patience, and all will go according to the Court's wishes
