N° 6n.

                                          Brest the 05 July 1773.

                                          The Flute la Seine
departed from this Port, and commanded by Mr.
de Vaucouleurs Captain of Fireship,
forming Part of the Division of Messrs. de
Gongis, has put in at Rio-Janeiro; the
Commander has sent a Packet
of Letters, the Motives for this
[Relasche] are not yet known.
     The Viscount de Roquefeuil Commander
of the Port, and commanding on leave since
of the Vessels of the Flag, went
yesterday to the Halls, and forbade all
those [quine sont] to go out until Eight
O'clock, on Pain of being [emprisés].
This Severity covered a Part of
the Night, and gave time to all these
the men and girls they would encounter.
This Jest makes the only
News of this Port.
