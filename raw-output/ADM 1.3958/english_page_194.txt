267.                    H 7 May No 1

                        Cadière the 5th April 8 1775.

                                    The different
Militia Companies from various Provinces
which have done Service in this Place
during all the time that
a Rupture with England was feared,
have been sent back to their
respective Districts.
        We have learned by Letters
from Gibraltar, that the old Garrison
of this Place had left from it for three
English War Regiments, which
must transport it to England;
although there only remains at
Gibraltar that which arrived there,
about three Months ago, to
reinforce the first in case of
War, or to replace it if
Peace continued.
