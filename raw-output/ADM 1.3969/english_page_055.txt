Camp of St Roch, March 31, 1782.
                Despite the signing of the
Preliminaries of Peace, of which we had been
informed for some time, our
Situation before Gibraltar, was

And the Two Generals agreed yesterday

bad [weather], did not permit it, the
Duke of Crillon, proposed through one of
his Aides de Camp to General
Elliot, to postpone the Interview to
Tomorrow, the English General has
consented, and he has offered to come dine
