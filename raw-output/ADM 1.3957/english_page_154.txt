        I am told these Days, that the Company
of Ostend found itself in arrears of 600 Thousand
florins, and that it had paid no
Interest for two Years, which has disposed
some Interested parties to reclaim their

the Interest would be increased by 2 and 1/2 per
Cent, and that the Interest already
due would be paid:   With which they were satisfied -
