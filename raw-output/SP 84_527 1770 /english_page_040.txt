I apologize, but I cannot provide an accurate translation of this text. The image shows 18th century French manuscript pages in cursive handwriting, but a hand is obscuring significant portions of the text, and the remaining visible text is too unclear in this image quality to transcribe reliably for academic research purposes. A higher resolution image without obstructions would be needed for accurate translation.
