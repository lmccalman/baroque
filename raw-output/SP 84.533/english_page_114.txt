This new Parliament is formed almost
entirely of former Magistrates. The
small number of New ones has been taken from
their Children, or among the Relatives, who have
been preferred to a great number of Bachelors,
who for the most part have returned to their Homes.
One expects for the Chamber of Accounts
and Court of Aids, which are still being born. The Lands
of the current Magistrates of this Parliament
are bequeathed in the State, which is printed.
Mr. Dufayet is the First President,
the Attorney General has been retained
but new Advocates General have been made
nothing has been changed until now in the Registry.
This Parliament has the same rights, that it
had for Registrations and
Remonstrances, but it is bound as I imagine
which greatly weakens the Authority with which it
had. The Sr. Mr. Bertrand assembled the
Chambers, and had several
unimportant things registered there. The Clergy, the
Nobles, the University, and all the Bodies have been
to compliment the new Senate.

The Grenadiers of France, which I had
incorporated into the New Regiments
of Militias, they have been brought back into the
Corps from which they were drawn.
