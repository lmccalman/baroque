desiring, or of punishing with the utmost extent of the
Records, which are indeed now grown to constitute
that they are not minded as they were at first.
The people are interested at the thought,
that the scheme of redeeming the finances was
first proposed in the year 1679, as shew by an
Marginal note in 1722 and that nothing to this day has
been done towards it, as however the violent malice
that they use can not be justified even by the utility
of the scheme, it is to be hoped that the best part
of the inhabitants will shew themselves the support
of the government.

I have the honor to be most respectfully
My Lord Duke

your grace's
most humble and
most obedient Servant
P. Wolters.
