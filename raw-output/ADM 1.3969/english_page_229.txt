of Two Ships, which managed to
save almost the entire Crew: -
The Dragon was going to Vera Cruz, to
seek Fruits and Silver there.
A Few Days before the Departure of
Don Pe de Galvez, the Frigate the St.
Lucy, had entered Havana
coming from Vera Cruz, with Two
Million Piastres for Commerce,
which immediately transported its
Treasure onto the St. John Nepomucene,
as well as some Fruits.
