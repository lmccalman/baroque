Madrid, October 6, 1782.

The King having received the
Ratifications of the Treaty of [similité] of the
Peace with England, [la plus publier]
last Thursday through the Streets of Arms,
and with all the customary Formalities.

One continues always to flatter
oneself here, that we will have Gibraltar by
Way of Negotiation.

It appears that our Court will
take no Part in the War
against the Turk, which threatens the Orient
of Europe.

Notwithstanding the immense
Expenses of the War, one has just
opened, and completed a new
Road from here to Cadiz.

The Princess of Asturias
and the Two Infantas are well.
