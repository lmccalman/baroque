Paris the 19. August 1773.

                                    You lose nothing
interesting from the Court, since the program for
the Retable, the Counselors of State and the Masters of
Requests gave you some time ago.
    [Deme] will not await you vis-à-vis the total
Suppression of the Parlements of Douay, which is
ordered, by Edict of the King, registered without
astonishment the day before yesterday; they will take a
Part of the Judges of this defunct Parlement
to form a Superior Council of
Flanders, whose Seat will be in Douay itself.
[Neance] Resident.
    The Marshal de Richelieu is going to leave,
it is reported, to be in Toulouse; from
Pau, from Bordeaux, to operate the Suppression
and erection of these three Parlements.
    The Destruction of the other Parlements
will come successively. Paris will be the Only
or rather the Registrations; all the others
receive the Edicts from Paris, and will be obliged
to register them without saying a Word.
    We still have in Paris two small
Jurisdictions, which have not recognized the
new Parlements; it is the Bailiwick
of the Palace, and the Waters and Forests. They are going to
                                    Suppress them
