Madrid the 20th December 1770.

Ordinances.

Death Penalty for the Deserter taken arms
after the Review of several Councils.

When nothing announces you more to the [Veillesse]
of the Dispatches, I am assured that this
Leon has given the most lively Responses,
and that If the Council of Government were
pointed to consent to it, and the [Scerilenes]
within 24 hours, the
Firm will be regarded as dissolved. If
this is so, one will know within 3 Days
of Days what to make of it.

The Preparations are not slowed down,
one continues both to embark
troops for Mexico, and to
garrison our Coasts.

I am written from Cadiz, that the Squadron
Commander Marquis de Casto Belo, is
in the Port with a Squadron of 6
Vessels, and that he must be reinforced
by several others, as this
that he must order for Havana.
