at Billon [Mouler] the Pieces of [Reillée]
were put in Place yesterday, they are being
pinned, a false Keel put on

it is estimated that all can be finished at the
end of this Month, no time is being wasted on it.

Work is being done to put the fresh
Provisions which they must arm with. The [tambourelle] has been
substituted for the [Audisocke],
Because of the Repairs to be made

which cannot be done afloat.
