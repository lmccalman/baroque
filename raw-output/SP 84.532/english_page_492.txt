A Trusted Friend has just told me,
that they will not disarm here at all before they
have disarmed in England, and that they
would like to make a Convention with the
Court of London to disarm in
coming Months, that however they have taken
the Intention here, to keep more than
Twenty hundred armed forces than usual,
inasmuch as the English have increased
their Squadron in the Mediterranean.
