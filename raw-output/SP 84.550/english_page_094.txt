fortune, high and low flourishes, and upon

     The First Officer said
Saturday at Versailles, to bring you the notice
of the Chambers to the King. His Majesty
declared that He would not renew
any Provincial Intendants
until the Acts and Declarations are
registered. The [Rotour]
[convenant] makes a King envious
to increase his Domain
     The Parliaments carry their

everywhere even three times
at the Parliament of women; a
King has signified a Decree, which
forbids him to return there, under Pain
of [Pontieux] corporal.
M. de Lavergle has taken Refuge
in the Intermediate Parliament;
Long live! his Crime.
