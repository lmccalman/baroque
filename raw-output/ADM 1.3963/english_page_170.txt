                                    Paris the 9th September 1778.

                                            I was informed from
Bordeaux on the 31st that the Marshal
de Mouchy, Commander of the
Pyrenees, had gone to the Town
of Palement, had held there in
the name of the King a Bed of Justice,
and had caused to be registered
by Authority, the famous edict
for the Liberty of Grain Trade
which causes much
trouble to the Inhabitants of
Bordeaux, who will no longer
be able to sell their Wines so dearly
to Foreigners.
            The Parliament of Paris is not very
pleased with this Si, having made
the Remonstrances
of the Procurer General, who
                                                            [circular stamp]
