servant, without recompensing him for it,
by giving him the Department
of being of the King's graces with Brancas.
And it was ordered to stay and to go
to the ladies' dinner at the Panoramas.

They write me from Berlin, that never
has the King been so magnificent as
on the occasion of the Grand Duke, and never
has he [n'étonnage] so much [Bortine]
and [Emille] to anyone, as to this
young Prince, who for his part has
shown [Deconation] and
Administration for the Monarch.

The Grand Duke has displayed there more
Talents and Merits, than had been
attributed to him until from afar. He said at
the Royal [Amea]: three Motives have
brought me here, the First, to give
myself there as a Hostage of an eternal
Friendship between the two Courts of Prussia
and of Russia. The Second, to
admire with my own Eyes the greatest
Monarch and the third, to
seek a Spouse and accomplish it, and
with whom I am enchanted.
