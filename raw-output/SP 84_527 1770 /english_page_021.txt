Response and Reflections

[Main text, top pages]:
The qualities of a Marshal? It is not enough to have
birth, valor, and prudence, one must also
have the science of war, the art of command, and that
capacity which provides the means to execute what one has planned.
It is not sufficient to have all these qualities, one must also
have them recognized, and have acquired a reputation
that inspires confidence. This confidence is necessary
to make oneself obeyed with authority, and to be followed with
zeal by the troops one commands.

Reflections on the most frequent faults of Captains
against care, chance, and their welfare.
Reflections on some details of conduct and character.
Reflections on the difference between defensive war and
offensive war, on the procedures between Enemies.

[Bottom page]:
There are some campaigns, and in the last war, one perceived
that the Generals often had views too extensive, and that they
wanted to do everything at once; so that in wanting to undertake everything
they did nothing decisive, and that their armies were dispersed
without being able to execute anything important.
