I hope will be forgiven, as it was not
real for the Service that prompted me to do
it.

Capt Hunt, who brought us the mail
of the 19th instant, was by the Ice forced on
down near Donnellysle; the River was
not yet open Covering nights; He was in
no way of receiving any damage. With the
wind was in, I do not question but having a
Packet boat in from England, time enough
to receive this day's mail, if Capt Hunt's
boats should not get ashore.

I am considerably better but very weak
I have the honour to be most respectfully
My Lord Duke
Your Grace's
most humble and
Obedient Servant
R. Dobson
