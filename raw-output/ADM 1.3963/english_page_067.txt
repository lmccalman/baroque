The Parliament of Besançon
having [dureté] its Intendant,
[le Trere de Cypro], sent into
[Monde] to arrest him; The latter
escaped through the windows,
and [se est venu à l'agréas].

The Object of the Quarrel is,
that the Members of this Parliament
did not pay the Vingtièmes
for their Property, the General [Impôtteur]
had an Order sent to
the Intendant, to make them pay
like the other Subjects of the King,
and Payment was forced.

It is for this reason that they [parfomt]
[gendarmes], saying, that by
the Capitulation, at the time of the Taking
of Besançon, they had obtained
this distinction. This is what
will be examined, we will see then
what will be decided.
