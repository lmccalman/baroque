The Marquis of St Auban, Lieutenant-
General, one of the most senior Officers
of Artillery, has died, as well as the
Marquis of Senneterre, Grandson of the
Marshal of that Name.

They write from Lyon, that the Archduke
Ferdinand, and his Spouse, have departed
from this City, where They stopped Eight
to Ten Days, They are going to take the Waters
of Aix in Savoy, and They will return
to Italy via the Tyrol. One is astonished,
that passing so close to the Courts of
Versailles, and of Turin, They do not
go to visit them; but They travel
only to restore their Health, moreover
the Emperor has, without doubt, traced
the Route that They had to follow.
