Private Letter

Paris, April 29, 1775.

There is much talk here
of a Memoir by Sieur Linguet, in
which he treats Mr. Turgot very badly, the
new General Staff of Finance, which is
all the more superior to all the others
as it is more filled with Men
of [Epuillon], and that the works have not
pleased, if it is that with the admission of this Minister,
he is [etat] of the Chancellor, which
would announce that these two [Provinages]
would abandon their Colleague.
He would denounce the Remedies that are made
known the future Election. It is a
Gallic Origin, which still needs
clarification. -

The disorders of [l'Aide de
l'Unite] are so horrible, for more than 6
Months, the fact made here and had as much
more and more, one regards the Disgrace
as inevitable, and one scarcely varies
except on the Time, which gives rise to
Wagers, the most moderate still give him
until the end of the Year. It is assured
that there are [tous] Personages who desired
to be his tone, because they would govern
through him.
