Madrid the 5th April 1748.

The persons, whom
I would put all possible attention
so that our Correspondence in all
respects [uterompues], marks and [ation]
are for the [eurique] of Lisbon to
London, & surely, no more than the
Governors can nothing new
in London, this fear can permit
to that. Since in the Letter
one had not point of Negotiations,
I am had precisions, that in the
times that I see this Correspondent
I would doubt equally
the Probity which reigns in the News
since Autumn in [Hambros]
of England.

The Letter that I have received since my
last from the Cabinet of London, are
in date of 24 February the letters are all
always in the same State, and that the island
there is until present no other
for armies, that one remains in the
[Prouesses] that other Regions the facts
in order to can nothing terminate by treaty
now a [grille] of
[touquelles].
