The Opening of the States of Lorraine was
at Oté on the First of September.

It is reported from Rome of the 8th that before the
Consistories that the Pope held on the 6th, he declared
the [Annégatoire] of the Brief that the Sens to have of the
Ordinance and the Mandates of M. the Archduke
O. Archbishop of Bremen, and to provide for the
vacant Bishoprics in Portugal. His Holiness has
in his Speech called [Eleye] of the King of
Portugal; and the said affection for the [Pret.age].

It is learned that the Affairs with the [Com-]
de Bourbon will they not be for [Sa] reconciliation:
and that very severe Orders for the [Autr.] their
Portugal has given a [Reize], and the ships of
war have already set Sail.

The News of an Embargo by [Rainte] on
the Portuguese and Venetian Vessels, is not
confirmed.

The Marquis de Marialva, Mr [Beyteur],
solicits strongly with the Emperor at Venice for
their [Belles], but he was refused, and they have
forbidden the Nobles to see this Lord
Venice, not wishing to quarrel with
the Porte.

P.S. At this Moment, I learn that there
is a great Scandal at Genoa, on the Subject of
of the Porte of the Law having already [Lonvenance]
Houses of [brouelles].
