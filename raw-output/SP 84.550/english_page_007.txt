Madrid December 14, 1773.

My Letters from this place
of the 7th current, announce to me, that
in the Courier of this Month, the
Troops destined for America,
must embark on large
Barges of the King, numbering
5 to 6 Regiments of
Infantry, and firstly those
of Bonzales, and of Zamora, of
Zamora, of Mileja, and of Saragoza;
but it is known, that the destination is not
for Buenos-Ayres, for those
of Bruxelles are destined for
Mexico, apparently to
relieve the Garrison. It is the
Chief, that is to say, Mr. d'Ulloa, who
is appointed to escort this
small Expedition, with some
Vessels of the King.
