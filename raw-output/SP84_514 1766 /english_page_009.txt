Mlle Clairon in Ansbach, is at her ease,
but I do not know clearly to whom she has
[dont] her mansion which is quite beautiful.

The Sorrow of Penelope, such is the
title of an interesting Brochure in 8°,
of 44 pages, containing Two Letters,
attributed to Mlle de Voltaire, the first
to Mr Rou, Master of Accounts in Lyon, [dans]
under the Name of Mr St. Huberti of Strasbourg,
they relate to calumnies
between these Two Men of Letters.
Mlle de Voltaire with the Frivolity that
is known to her, reproaches all that may
be fitting of ridicule, and something
more, to the Ex-Citizen of Geneva who
seems to have been lost in the Public,
[Hanneau], Esteem, Consideration, and
who is reduced to the sad Advantage
of exciting Commiseration; but she
praises and renders that which she is strongly
will she be insensible to these laurels
and to these supplications, if she will not
be we not us by the arrows that are
launched at her with so much Relentlessness.
