My Lord

Your Lordship will, no doubt, have been
informed of the Death of Mr Watters, of which
Mr Stathouwer & my son in M. O'Brien by the
last Post of the 17th Instant, has Day we had
he expired he made an appointment, at 3 o'Clock
& four that Mr Brownlow Watters had omitted
writing to your Lordship on that melancholy
Occasion, to save People the trouble of making that
Excuse, will be by no means necessary, as Mr Watters
himself some time ago had left by your Lordship
was at the head of his Departed friend.
I have only to add my Lord, that I have
a Letter, with us, and leaving the other,
who both beloved & esteemed us. I hope
that your Lordship will make sure one
act from his agent, a great destructive loss
circumstances by such a noble example, can
make us doubt but Mr Brownlow de Grace
has been kind enough to buy my care and much
to me with the little personal effects he left,
before your Lordship shall see them
of which mention Watters has a mother thing
had the care of his intended donation in
on one half with his Excellency, his
Lordship de Grace to whom I have the
Honour

To His Excellency the Earl of Ilchester
