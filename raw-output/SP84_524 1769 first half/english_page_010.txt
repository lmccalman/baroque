and particularly in these Successive Wars as
in the last Rebellion, in Action and
Correspondence. I can safely appear
to the Testimony of Lord Gower, Lord
Sandwich, Lord Holdernesse, and
Professor Yorke who have Successively
resided as the King's Ministers at the
Hague, that all their Orders to my
Deputy, have been most punctually
executed; and as in these Affairs
there have been often transactions
of great trust, It Shews that It is
material to have a trusty Person in
that office.
   Such a one I am certain of having
found in Charles Reuhe, if I can obtain
for him the Allowance, which I am
not able to give him myself.
