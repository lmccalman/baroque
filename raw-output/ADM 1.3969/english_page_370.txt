Paris the 28th June 1788.

                        Nothing new from
our ports.

            It is assured that the principal
articles of our treaty of alliance with
the Dutch are agreed upon and
settled, but what could delay
the entire conclusion of this treaty is
that the Dutch demand our
guarantee for all their Possessions
in Europe, which we cannot
promise, in the current circumstance,
because of their dispute
with the Emperor.

            It is absolutely believed that the
stay of the Count d'Artois [suit], as
well as that of the former minister of
the Duke of [Deux], have as their purpose some
great negotiation, however one
does not perceive that the principal
agents have engaged in long conferences
