445.                                                    B. 16. Octo. No 1

                            St Ildefonse the 25th September 1770.

                            The Count de la Fayette des Boys
The Port Catalina (one of those which have been
used in the Expedition of the Falkland Islands)
has arrived in the Rio de la Plata on Saturday,
and the Commander did me the honor
to serve me by announcing to him no Vessel,
not even the Coast Guards; but after
having withdrawn all his People, he has
allowed approach of a single Vessel
to carry Dispatches to the Admiral
Marquis de Victoria, who immediately
sent an Express to the Court.

The English frigate the [Riesagne]
loaded with a considerable quantity
of oysters, has been at Rio the Witness
of this Operation.

You will kindly explain to the King,
Sir, the Vessels of [Ruis], the [Dcminge]
destined for Rio Salée, and for
the Kingdom of forces, had set sail
some Days ago for their Destination
for the Port Catalina; but by
a signal that was made to them from the tower,
they have returned to anchor in the
Bay of Cadiz.
