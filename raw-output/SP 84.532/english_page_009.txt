Private                                Rotterdam 8th January 1773.

My Lord

                    I have the honour to inclose
to your Lordship the last Letter I have
the correspondence produced by Lord
Rockford orders by Comte d'Amsterdam,
that your Lordship may determine
if it will be worth while to alter the
Resolution which I had taken to discharge
him with his Quarter, or if he should
be continued, I have referred him
for a final Answer to the Return of
the Post from England.

        My Resolution was taken upon the
Justiciary of his former deliveries;
but the inclosed contains intelligences
of the truth or at least of the probability of
which your Lordship will be much a
better able to judge than I am prepared
to do.

        I have this day received Information
from Mr. Burnell of 9,008-41.8d of Salt peter
                                        that
