        The Panel having promised to the Court
the Declarations of Andreas & of John forbes
and the prisoners being brought before the
Court, were desired to let them in,
1st. that by his former negatives he had justly
disgrounded a necessity to find proofs against
him, by which, persons being found he could be
convicted, and that it was also for required
that he would tell the truth. He then was
answered.
2 that he still persisted in his former denial
and that he would undertake to answer with
his much as was in his power-
        The Declaration of the two attendants of
the Justices at Rotterdam being by me read
and explained to the Prisoners; and shewing
and him at the bar each were not much alike
while persisted in his denial of having any votes
to carry the votes raised by these Declarations
