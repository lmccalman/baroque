Regents both by their masters, and who chose the
Dates, have broke their word to them, have let a-
them pass unmolested.

The Duke of Newcastle Sir was last-
monday morning from Whitehall, and preparations being
at Hannover have been on thursday near.

The news of the french court having once
more suspended the duty of 50 livs per ton on Dutch
shipping, gives great joy here.

I have the honour to be most respectfully-

My Lord Duke

Your Grace's

most humble and
most obdt servant
W. Weston.
