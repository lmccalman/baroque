                    Paris the 30th December 1778.

                            There have just appeared
Two Regulations of the King, Work
of Mr. Necker, and which are
generally applauded. The First concerns
the Exterior of the Household, the
Majesty assigns a fund, so that the
Suppliers of Provisions of the Court
are exactly paid every
Year, as well as the Wages of the
People employed at the Castle;
His Majesty orders, that in order
to introduce Economy in
all the Parts of the Expense
of his Household, all the Chiefs
will submit there within two Months
a Statement of what one could
do to diminish the Expense,
without disturbing anything in the Order
that the Splendor of the Crown will require.

                                                    &c.
