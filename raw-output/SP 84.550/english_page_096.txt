You desire that a Quantity
thereof may be sent over, never the-
less I should be obliged to you, if you
would fix that Quantity, as to how far
because I can make no Calculation
of what may be required for
the future Experiments. It ma-
be thought proper to make after all.
Upon your further Orders, I
shall write for it immediately,
and Send you the Bill of Lading
when Shipped here for London,
with an Account of the Cost
and Charges.

I have the Honour to be
with due Respect.

Sir

your most humble &
most Obedient Servant

L.D. Blake.
