N. 13 May

Paris the 2d May 1782.

                    We have nothing new
from our Ports. Nothing very
interesting is happening either at Court, or in
the City.

           It appears at present that the
Ship la Bourgogne of 84 cannons,
& the Squadron of Mr. de Vaudreuil, has taken
the crew was saved, at least the
greater part.

           The King has granted Thirty Thousand
Livres in Pensions to Mr d'Estaing;
until a great Governorship becomes vacant which is
promised to him; the first being promised to
Mr le Rochambeau, Mr d'Estaing will have
the 2nd vacant.

           The Duke of Crillon & others has
been well rewarded by the King of Spain.
