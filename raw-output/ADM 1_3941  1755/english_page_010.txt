at Brest the 25th of March 1754


                    Everything announces to us
an imminent War, and we cannot
doubt if one should confirm it to us
by the Orders given, and the
preparations that are being made.
      One prepares diligently
to arm Twenty new Warships,
it is already said that it will be
Mr Duguay who will command
this last Squadron.
      Positive Orders have been
given to put in good State
all the Batteries that are on
the Coasts.
      The Ships from Rochefort
are expected on the 20th of this
month, none has yet appeared; all
those that are armed in this Port
will be in the Roads next
Week.

                                        All
