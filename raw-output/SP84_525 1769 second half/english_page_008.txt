Extract
from a Letter from Brittany.

In the Crisis in which the
Affairs of this Parliament find themselves in Relation to the Claim
of the Four Counselors and the Two Prosecutors-
General, and by the unknown Decree of the [Dueil d'Arpailleur]
[Sons] in the Official Affairs the Parliament of Nantes
itself has not paid its [acre] to the Chamber, and
therefore, it is necessary, [regregnez] an effervescence in Hearts,
as if the Palace could be built for it.
Our Bretons protest, that if the Court
[n'étant] its [prérières] Sparks into Fire,
it is to be feared that despite all the most
prudent, and that by the Development of
Investigations, there may arrive Orders from the King to
make Copies against the abuse, both past and future.
All the Page of the Parliament, [Mtre] de Duroc, is
greatly affected by this Resentment. He agrees
to give himself all sorts of Movement, and
more skillful woman, more laborious of Scandals
and Rumors. As for the Court, one can judge
how much the Council is attentive in this Body:
One forms Leave in a famous [Bavure],
engaging through all the labyrinth of
Difficulties, it threw it, and there remained
only halves, all the bad Work done
in this Pair.
