having permitted to come to you
to beseech you to do me the honor of
granting me an audience in order to
have that of representing to you
the circumstances which compel me
to beseech you to be willing to
do me the grace of granting me
your protection.
     I have the honor of being with a
very profound respect

                                        Richelieu
