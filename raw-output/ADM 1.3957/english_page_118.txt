Consent of the King, that the Declaration
Declared by the Declaration which orders that
during four Years the Reimbursements
to be made of the Capital and Engagements, shall be
employed to reimburse the future Rents and
the Life Annuities created since the first
Lotteries with Modifications, or from the
public yesterday. Here is how far presents what
may have to be brought to the Balance.

The Commerce of Boulainvilliers afflicted by the
Orders given by the King has just had carried
into a Parliament of Brittany an Act for
[perdition] the [Entendant], and [exlicité] this just

render a Decree, to which an Ordinance which
forbids the export of Money; but this has

Letter that comes from the Ordinance to Wait for it, and
and orders that it be executed. This
news was brought the day before yesterday by a
[Courrier expéditionnaire] to Versailles.

with the [Clos-louis] internal to the Magistrates of the
Authorities, and which is very at [Saints] to [qu'ger]

nothing has been obtained, do not wish, nor with this

to claim
