It is the constant and immutable will of the Sovereign opposing itself to the surprising rebellion and commanding resistance.

However, after this, could Your Majesty be astonished at the resistance that his Edict encounters in the Parlement of Paris against the new principles, these principles avowed and known to the present Ages of Morality, and which presents the opposing maxims as ancient, and types consecrated in our history: But where in its preamble began its [dumes] its fatigues, that [inéprisables], and restless and incurable spirits, who spread the poison of irreligion and impiety: working against enemies of the Magistracy, who tend toward the complete destruction of Arguments against which it has in all times deployed the severity of the Laws.

The Magistrates, Sire, do not change principles. The fury with which they have [peindre] their sentiments. We have exposed to Your Majesty our indifference in all centuries.

Your Parlement of Paris was therefore in the powerlessness to lend its ministry to the publication of your Edict. To register it would have been [tendue infaisant], and refractory to the Laws. To subscribe to the preamble of this Edict, which would have been to its own abasement; and such is the position in which your Parlement found itself master, that it was reduced to the alternative either of recognizing itself guilty in registering, or of appearing to disobey in resisting.

This foreseen position was a goal that the event has manifested. They wished, Sire, to avenge themselves upon the Members of the ancient resistance, and [des déclamations acrimonieuses] against the violences previously experienced; and to achieve this, they wished to procure for themselves a pretext for the overthrow of the Laws.

One must place oneself in this point of view to appreciate the Edict and the conduct of your Parlement.

The most injurious imputations are proposed to Indiscipline. They make a crime of the proscription, of the fabricators. They say that by protecting in some manner, and by making a subject of State of it, some of the Kingdom, by dishonoring the Majesty: [rendoit quelle soient démarche contre, ne : tenait qu'à l'argent de La Croix] by dishonoring the Enlightenment of their Country.

That the fabricators of notes dare complain at the resistance: give the past evils as monuments of their politics: that the police [en parvient] in the prefects. Oppression, and that [des artifices vicieux malveillances & des imperfections militaires] are the victims, and it follows therefore that the Parlement, to stop at the mountains and without but commits without motive like harming: fatal the ancient would have been able, by title of publishing this; [dénomina] the that if we to the state of defense all the Sovereigns however we [ditmis] toward to under new [prôner], who are carried, that the declarations [exergées] of the Members of your Parlement, by virtue of which the resources to achieve of each of them very useless, the will never be able to make Assembly and in particular, even less form the resistance of the same desirable. One will never regard as dictated by Your Majesty a [sormulaire] of questions which would have presented the [teindre] disobedience the [dérobérade] to the present orders, and [Ingénie] of to [derobe] disobedience to your orders on any response which would be conformable to the wish of the Company, to which each individual would not have been [deroger] without betraying his oath.

These are nevertheless, Sire, the responses if these Magistrates, although served as pretext to declare, [vacanier] an innumerable [number] of offices of Presidents and Counselors of your Parlement, to snatch from the Sanctuary of justice Magistrates to whom the enemies of the Laws frequently give preference for being incorruptible, to deprive them of their liberty, and to relegate a great part of them in the least comfortable places, and whose evils were almost unknown.

The Law [délate] the Decree of 18 June [inviemariable], and a simple Act of your Council strips it of [signifie propose]. The Law promises that the Magistrate must not be deprived nor [alloué], and must not be [voté d'espenses]
