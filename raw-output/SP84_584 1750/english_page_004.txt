My Lord Duke -

I have nothing material to add to the inclosed Intelligences -

The Commissioners named by the States of Holland to examine in to the State of the new Taxes are expected here tomorrow. It is not imagined that they will be able to clear up all the difficulties of the Taxes, which absolutely obstruct the trade of this place, the news of the Jewad Council having ordered the Duty of 30 sols per ton, which had been suspended for six months to be now again paid by Dutch Ships, is a melancholy prospect for the navigation of this Republick, of which there is formed another more considerable branch.

His Grace the Duke of Bedford.
