in this office, or which I can mention nothing in my
letters to Sir Edward Littleton--

Maurice is I am told a Rebel, (or at least
though suspected of being one) and Kingston Scheme
was to have in the Castle brigade in this territory
which, I am very to try it, is a refuge for all
fugitive Scotchmen and a nursery for Disaffected
Rascallion--

I have the honour to be most respectfully

My Lord

your Lordships

most humble and most
Obedient Servant
