the property was not accompanied. He was supposed to receive a paper
in proper form which has not been given to him, he asks that I be
charged with having it expedited, that would in fact be quite easy, the
men of business always do it in these cases, but when
and at what time. I am careful not to take charge of anything, the
family being divided as it is. I responded to him that
I could not meddle in anything, that he had to address himself to
M. de la Brunetiere who had the confidence of the whole family,
that he was a man of honor, and that one need only speak to him.
He told me that that was precisely what he did not want to do,
because he feared that someone might quibble with him, and that
they might make him pay fees. I responded to him that I did not believe
that anyone wanted to deceive him, that on the contrary they would seek
to accommodate him, that he had to go about it early, and
that otherwise he could be exposed to delays which would be
more prejudicial to him. He told me that he would think about it, and
that he would make his decision. I believed I should give you an account
of this conversation, so that you may use it as you
judge appropriate. I beg you to believe me with a respectful
attachment, Sir, your very humble and very obedient servant.
