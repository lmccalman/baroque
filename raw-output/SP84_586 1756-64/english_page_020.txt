which has been going on for several days because of
our entertainments - he asked me to come
dine at his place tomorrow - I accepted his
invitation - I found at my place Mr. de Pont
who had been waiting for me for more than an hour -
he informed me of a matter with which he wants
me to be charged - I promised him to give
it my attention - I supped at my place -
letters from Paris were brought to me - they
contain nothing interesting - I
spent the evening reading them and responding to them -
I had a visit from Mr. the abbot who came
to say goodbye to me because he is leaving tomorrow to
return to his place - we conversed
together until ten o'clock - after his
departure I worked still until
midnight - I went to bed very tired
