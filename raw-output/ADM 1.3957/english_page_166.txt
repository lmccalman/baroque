have inspired in the Natives of the Country,
and to make the treaty


                    Brussels, April 26, 1710.

            The States of Brabant
proposed yesterday to raise a Million
in Life Annuities on the Credit of
the Province, but the Commons
do not want to consent to it, unless
the Noble Estate raises it on its
own Credit, without involving the
Commons in it.
