The Elector of Cologne had
committed himself to have transported with
[pair bas] 800 thousand pounds of powder,
and that one of Trier to deliver two
thousand bombs, and a great quantity
of wood, suitable for making
gun carriages from it; but last Friday a
courier was dispatched from here to these
two electoral courts, with counter
-orders; which is regarded here as
very strong proof that we
will not have war.
