To M. De*** N°3

                                    Paris the 2nd December 1770.

                                                        Here are, my dear Uncle,
                    my other abbreviated Notes.
                    The war sheets announce
                    the departure of two Battalions which are going
                    to rejoin the Garrison destined for the
                    property of the Isle of [Galdagne]; but
                    that she wants to make of it an Object of
                    Negotiation, which [l'éclé] projects in
                    Compensations with the English, and
                    that she [troupera] to publish the article of
                    the Article of the Reunion of the [Manilles].
                    However it is reported from London
                    that M. Henley is named Ambassador
                    of England.
                    One will wait in the Orient for
                    the Changes of [Ouvateurs], one
                    will work at [Cry] only that the King
                    takes for Directors, one will wait
                    before departing the others, that there
                    be something decided for the
                    war.
                    There is an Armament of
                    our Coasts in Brittany and in Ireland,
                    there are already several Vessels, where the
                    Bourgeoisie mounts Guard at the Fishery
                    of Barks that are ready.
                                                                                                            M.
