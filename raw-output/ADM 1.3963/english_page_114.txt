N. piece N.° 9.

Toulon, the 22. May, 1778.

They have begun the
Refitting of the Protecteur the Solide, they will
✓ not succeed this Lent, but rather
in [floréaumont], and moreover one finds the
powers to maneuver soon seven
others without experiencing discontent
in working.

They will recommence Tomorrow the
Refitting of the César, and another; but
✓ one is finished, that this Refitting will not be
completable

The Egypte the Allemade, are [bondes]
✓ entirely by their goods.

The Comète has no recovery.
✓ The Comète washes well. The Lac
Caméléon goes in honored grace.

They have found the Sardine in good
State, one wants to reason for the
✓ Levant.

The Comète is always very well.
