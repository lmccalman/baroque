among other things, that until this day, there
were nearly Three Thousand Houses
burned and ruined, that the Senate
and the Porte were [immandes], that all
the Mole was ruined, that they had
burned or sunk Three
large Vessels, and Five other small
Ships, that the Consternation was

of a number of Moors, for having

of the King of Morocco, who had
openly refused them the Aid
that they were asking of him against
His Friend the King of Spain.
It remains to be seen what all this
will lead to.
