been possible, for our tranquility. Let us be
persuaded of the Vigilance that has been employed
so that nothing may disquiet us, and let not

no Attention to it, because it
might even be connected by Design to
divert us from the unique Operation which
must occupy us. Let nothing finally
distract us from this Moment, which must
decide our Fate and that of our
Posterity.
