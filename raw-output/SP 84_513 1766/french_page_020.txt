This Correspondents fee & I can
vouch for, but as to the Merits of his
Advices, they can only be judged of

I have this Day also wrote to Mr

Subject.

I have the Honour to be
most Respectfully,
        My Lord Duke

                Your Graces

                most humble and
                most Obedient Servant.
