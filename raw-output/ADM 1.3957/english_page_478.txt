N. 22 Nov. No 3.

Paris the 20th November 1776.

Our Letters from Madrid
of the 29th October say, that they are finally arming
in all the Ports of Spain, and that the
Troops are setting out marching from all Sides,
the Ones.

I am very certain that the Troops are
marching, 20. Battalions have Orders
to proceed to Brittany, 20. to
Normandy, and 20. to Provence.

As for the rest, there are always
Reasons for doing it and for saying it,
but all of it is not so.

It is reported that on the 5th December the King
will come to the Palace to register
an Edict of Discipline, which will put a
Brake on the young Men of the Parlements;
this affair, if it takes place, will have
Consequences.

I know that there are Projects concerning
Kensington; but that this moment is greatly
delayed, which brings shame to this Master.
The Comptroller General wishing to establish
Equality, Confidence, does not cease to
restore to vigor the Bills of the
Farms
