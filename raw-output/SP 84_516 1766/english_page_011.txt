N° 2.

Rotterdam the 6 January 1764

Sir

By mistake the Amsterdam Barg
of the French and Flemish Mail is gone to
the Hague, and the Hague Barg is come
hither, at the Hour that I was writing
the mistake is not remedy'd, and
consequently I am not expected to have
the Intelligences in time to have them
ready for the Post.

I have the Honour to be most Respectfully

Sir


Your most humble and
most Obedient Servant

R. Wolters
