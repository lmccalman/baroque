Rotterdam January 12th 1758.

Lord Duke,

     I think myself in justice obliged to
inform Your Grace, that the delays delivered
of the loss or prize that Milo has been accussioned
by no negligence in Mr Lauriston, and the
Masters of the Privatiers, but is entirely
owing to the inconveniencies of the season, so
Your Grace will be by the two inclosed.
     I have the honour to be most Respectfully


                    Lord Duke

                         Your Graces

                              most humble and most
                              obedient Servant
                                   R. Devereux

His Grace the Duke of Newcastle 1758
