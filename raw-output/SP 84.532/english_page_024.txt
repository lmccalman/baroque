N°. 9.

Paris the 22 December 1779.

My letters from Toulon,
of the 20th, speak only of the Arming
of the Batteries, and no Orders
yet to arm.

One has well expected for a long time
some Changes in the
Ministry, the Division was so intense
that this could not last any
longer.

[Dumas] the Replacement of some
of the Chiefs of the Two of la Villiere, [Se]
went to the Duke of Choiseul, and
signified to him the Order of the King to resign
from His two Departments, and to
Retire to his lands, and to [de Se]
reform Similarly to the Hospital.

The Duke of Aguillon spoke these words
to the Duke of la Villiere Duke of la Ville [Se]
presents with Two [Bts d'etape] to the
Duke of Choiseul, to see him go
to Chanteloups other than His family
without an express Permission from the
King to go and come in His
Province the Rights of His
Government.
