The Vessels destined to go
be decommissioned at Rochefort, and to transport
the 10 Companies there, were to depart
Tomorrow, commanded by Mr de La
touche Tréville. The Officers destined
for Rochefort, depart Wednesday;
this will create a bit of emptiness here,
which will be very good, for one did not
know where to lodge them, and provisions
were very expensive.

Many Officers of this
Department had been requesting to be
[Rétorité] for a long time; there arrived
last Friday Only Eleven
namely, one Captain, Seven Lieutenants,
and three Ensigns. Some are
Old ones, and the others have nothing.

Mr de Boynes returns has departed
three hours ago.

I am from the 9th in 1773 and the
Decommissionings.
