                        Paris the 23rd April 1770./

                                    We have
nothing from our Ports.
    Our Colonies not needing troops
nor Recruits, we therefore cease making the Levies;
and we are sending a Battalion to
America before the Month of September.
    However we continue to embark
Soldiers for the Indies and even that they
carry provisions themselves.
    Messieurs de la Chalotais have [ensuyés]
a Petition to the Parlement, bearing the
Regulation against the Duke of Aiguillon;
and the Petition is Admitted, and it's an
Affair that will make a great stir.
    Messieurs the Estates [d'Affe. d'Ille de Chevilles],
at the Palace, where the Princes and Peers will gather,
awaiting the Assembly of the [S. indigités]
at Versailles.
    The Petition, presented to the [B.S.l] by the
Merchants, Bankers and Holders of the
Bills of the Farms, has been answered favorably,
there will come today an Order of the
Council which will settle the Fate of these Bills;
this has made them increase by [V.H.] half
per Cent.
                                                            On.
