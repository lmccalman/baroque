We are informed, that the Prince of
Stahremberg, Minister and Grand
Master of the Emperor's Household,
will arrive here in three or four
Days; the Orders so that the
Equipages not be searched
at the borders, were given
the day before yesterday. Some see in him
a Plenipotentiary Minister;
but what does he come to do here?
Others assure that he comes here
without any Public character.
