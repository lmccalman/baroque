235.

Dated the 2nd May 1792.

The two Battalions
which left Dunkerque, went to
St Omer, and two other Battalions have
replaced them, so that the Garrison of said
Dunkerque always consists of 2g - tion
Battalions.

However it may be, one sends to depart from [nes]
[l'Istanna] for America, the Remainder of the
[détenues] of [Jourfrois], and there is time
that one had very few people there.

One begins to prepare the Battalions
for the [Corée] of the Rampart.

Despite the King since reigns at Dunkerque
one prepares oneself there to celebrate the Jubilee of one,
of Anniversary.

One continues the works to improve
the Camp and the Court of Rampart, but one
works there with too few People.
