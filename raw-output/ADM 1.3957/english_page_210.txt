227

Tomorrow we await the current Number of
Captains, and that of the great Number
of Officers who will be Dismissed; many have
already been put on the Ships
that are in the Port.

¶ We have Letters from Constantinople
by which we learn, that the Grand
Seigneur has sent 20 large Ships
to go fight the 4 Russian ones, which
have as many, and well armed;
&, the Heating up of the Russians against the
Turks, and of the Turks against the Russians,
announces a Bloody Tragedy;
they had wrongly negotiated the
Russians, their Ships and Crews
are in good State. [De y a bien des
ames dans que le Bombardement qu'elles
causent, ne détruise bien Essai];
to know that one need only live.

¶ The Spanish are also arming; but
that announces to us only [l'Yne Myrthère]
which will develop soon.
