[Due to the 18th-century cursive handwriting style, image quality, and shadows in the photograph, I cannot provide a reliable character-by-character transcription of this text. The handwriting is extremely fine and flowing, making individual words difficult to distinguish with certainty. A proper transcription would require either a higher resolution image, better lighting conditions, or expertise in paleography specific to 18th-century French manuscripts.]
