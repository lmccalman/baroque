Brest the 29 May 1783.

Of the Eight Galleys that were
to be armed. [Londre font] destined to
go to Italy. The Destination
of the others is unknown.

The King [viens-permettre] to depart us
to go take Possession of the Islands of
St. Pierre and Miquelon. Several
Families who were returning to their ancient
Homes are already on board this Vessel
which will not depart for the [vu l'heur heureux]
Isles only the Isle of Aolstadt. The English having
sent to Newfoundland, a Ship
of the Line, and some Frigates, one did
not flatter oneself that we would have them
followed by the Ariel alone, but one
expects, that the Romulus, upon leaving
the Service of our nation, was [en-
cendre] at Newfoundland, to [m'hotter]
with the Ariel, to the Response of my
Professions.

The Construction of Two large
Vessels, continues with speed;
that of Two Frigates is well
advanced.
