regime of the administration of
the royal navy.

5. In the Convention made with
the King of Sweden, in order to give
no umbrage to the maritime
powers, it especially to England,
it is recalled there that since [l'ngleme]
Sweden had granted us a
similar depot, it was the port of
Wismar, we could hardly make [usag] of it,
but that of Gothenburg being better
situated, it will be able to become very useful
for our trade, and even more
for the royal navy when
we have a port in the
Channel, then all the naval
supplies that we will draw from the North,
will no longer come by land, in time
of war, assembled at Gothenburg,
a favorable wind will carry them to
the Channel in eight to ten days.
