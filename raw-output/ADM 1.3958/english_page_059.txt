Mr Harris who received the order to
return to London, took leave
of the Court last Monday, and plans
to depart in a short time. 
They have sent the order to Prince Mastram
to resume here the Service of
Captain of the Body Guards.
    [Saurois par] you give these
two [Affilles] last Monday, but
not believing them interesting enough,
I postponed it until today.
