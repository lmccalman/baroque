The Loan was to be settled
at the Council last Sunday,
but it appears that it is still delayed
until one knows with more
Certainty whether one will hold for
Peace, or for War, because
if the King is not obliged to arm,
it is useless to offer 6½ per Cent
to the Lenders, the Finances and the
Credit of the State are in a
Situation, to give in Time of
Peace, only 5. or 5½ per Cent, at
most. The Submissions for
this Loan amount to, three
Days ago, 504. Millions.
