Extract from a Letter
from the Dardanelles of January 30, 1773.

We have for some
time no news of the Squadron of the
Orloff Islands; it is said that that of [Poloine
Riff] which comes to reinforce it, has arrived in
Italy.

They continued to have [vister] the [Baguements]
necessary for the Defense of this Strait, which
had not been undertaken to do upon arrival,
because of December from which there has [Conference
de Potoratz] until now. The
fortifications that are being made on one side of this
are good; but they will lack
[topts] capable of defending them.

Unfortunately [Russe] is neither loved nor
respected by the troops; who carry themselves to
all sorts of excesses and Disorders;
it is however only gold, that [Mauripers],
and there is no safety in the Streets,
even during the Day. It is in vain
that the Sultan makes every effort to
discipline the Ottoman troops;
among the Recruits, they no longer want
to recognize a Chief, [la Rasengnabie],
and [l'Ingeunérie], were the [ancleunes] panics
                                        of which
