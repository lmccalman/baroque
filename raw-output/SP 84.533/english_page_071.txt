Madrid the 25th July 1779.

I am written to from Cadiz,
that the two Warships, the Prince and
the Dragon, mentioned in one of my
previous ones, have set Sail for the Canary
Islands; but that the Dragon had the
misfortune of running upon a Bank,
from which it could not withdraw; that having
fired some Musket Shots, two
English Frigates, and a Dutch one,
which were in that Roadstead, have
sent to its Assistance their Launches
with Anchors and Cables, and have had the
Good Fortune to Save this Vessel.

Seen reports from Cartagena, that
they are now decommissioning the four
Warships, and the Frigate
returned from Barcelona, where they have
transported the two Swiss Walloon
and Spanish Battalions.
