The Parlements of Toulouse, and
of Dijon, having rendered Decrees
which derogated from the public Tribunals
of the two Regulations, the
King not recognizing in any way the Grand
Council, this Grand Council has rendered
Two Decrees, which charitably quash
those of the Provincial Parlements,
as attacks on the Authority
of the King, &c. There is the War declared
between the Robins; it is much feared,
that the Grand Council will be
punished, for having the Peace.

Two Volumes have just appeared here,
entitled, Letters of the late Pope
Ganganelli; they are very well
written, and I have been told that one must judge,
that the Connoisseurs challenge,
that they were composed in
Paris, where is the Author of Histories.
However it may be, one will
read them with pleasure.
