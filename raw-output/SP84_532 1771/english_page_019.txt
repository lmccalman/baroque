for the payment of urgent debts, and to provide for
the most pressing needs, and that after having made
these arrangements, nothing remained to him for
his daily needs, nor for the expenses of his
household, and that he was in the necessity of resorting
to the charity of his friends to subsist, and that he
had no other resource than that one, and that he
was in the impossibility of paying his debts, and
of satisfying his commitments, and that he requested
consequently that it might please the Court to discharge him
from his obligations, and to grant him a safe-conduct
to retire to a place of safety, where he might
live tranquilly sheltered from the pursuit of
his creditors, and that he engaged on his part
no longer to contract any debt, and to live
in retreat and in economy, and to employ
all his care to discharge himself little by little of what he
owed, as much as his means would permit him,
and that he hoped that the Court would be willing to have
regard for his unfortunate position, and grant him
the favor that he solicited with insistence.
