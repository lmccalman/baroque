               Second.

          Madrid the 27. May. 1776.

          On the 24th of the Current month, near
our Environs, the Regiment of
[miselle] of St Basile, going to Old
Castile, and a Detachment of frigates from
Sweden, has already arrived; I am sending it
in Garrison to Toro. That of the
foreign Volunteers is equally
on the March to go there. Thus
little by little the greater Part
of our Army approaches the
frontiers of Portugal, as much in
Old Castile, as in
Estremadura.
          The same Letters from Barcelona
report, that they are preparing there in the
greatest secrecy trains of Artillery
with all the Necessary supplies, Wagons
of Campaign, &c.
          Moreover, it is believed, that they have given

                                        order
