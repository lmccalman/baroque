one Ship still there, one of 58 and another of
54, a Frigate and two Merchant Ships of 40 Guns
each. Upon the whole it would appear that
there are about twenty Sail of the Line at
the present moment preparing for immediate
service in the Spanish Ports.

Mr. Trevor.    I should hardly have been able from those
on Behalf of the Adm'y  trifling Data that I command will ever intelligence
                    I have received from you this moment.

The Master of a Ship from Cadiz, who arrived
there the 24th told the Consul that as the morning
of the Black having between Cap de Sat and the
Island of Pines, he saw nine Ships of three, all
of the Line, with one small Cutter: they were
lying to, and became them all the day, in the
evening they set their Sails and stood to the
Southward. It was now enough to distinguish
their Sea Ports so that they were Ships after war,
but could not tell of what Nation; he thought he
counted his Colours they did not shew any in
return; the Cutter bore down to him and after
reconnoitering, rejoined the Fleet. Mr. Trevor
