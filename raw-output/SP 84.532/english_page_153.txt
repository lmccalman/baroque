N° 11.

Paris le 5 Fevrier 1775.

                                          Monsieur,

Ordinarily the Archbishop of Auch does
respond almost only to Monsieur the Chancellor.
It is assured that the Duke of Aiguillon [infaste]
of other friends & more skillful, but the King
himself, it is said, persecutes him in the opi-
nions so that the Magistrate may prevent.
The great Magistrate wavers for the
imported Teachers & his sentiments;
one claims that by this chance or better assured,
all the other high revenues of France
have all the other high revenues in Canada
Only dependent on a Single Parliament
which sits in Paris, only the [Canev];
There will be [souvenentes] Inquiries in
all the other Cities of the King of this
Constitution in form where the Lords
new Code to simplify the
Procedures, where they will no longer need
Attorneys, each Party will provide
the documents Signed by the Clerk
at the Hearing, one overturns this French time
entirely, because the Courts will not
last long, and [nourement]
the Parties anymore!
While awaiting above all news
Parliament enters the Palace every
                                          Days.
