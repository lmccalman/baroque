to send has had no Consequence.
I finish by making a Journey
to Malta, in the same Regiments
where the man was during
my Absence.

Request from the Cape of 2nd July,
that M. d'Estaing was to depart
from it from the 12th to the 15th, to return here
which sometimes means that the Order
that was sent to Him to return

The Vessel which carries this Order
also brings to M. d'Estaing the Summary
of the interview and the General of the
Armies of the King.

It has long been a
Problem to know if it is better
to sometimes make troops in front
to the Colonies, or to send in Corps
of troops by Details and destined
for this Service? A great
inconvenience relative to both.
