ne of all the persons who surround her. I cannot 
recommend too strongly that you render to her all the duties 
of a sincere affection, to show her much 
respect and to seek to please her on every occasion.
She is a woman of distinguished merit who has always 
had for me the most tender sentiments and who 
has given me the most marked proofs of her friendship.
I am persuaded that you will not fail to 
show her all the gratitude that I owe her and 
that you will seek to merit her benevolence through 
your conduct and through your attachment to me.
I pray you to give her my most 
respectful compliments and to assure her of my inviolable 
attachment. I wish that she may enjoy 
perfect health and that Heaven preserve her long 
for the happiness of all those who have the honor of 
knowing her. You may tell her that I think 
often of her and that I desire keenly to see her again.
Farewell, my dear friend, I embrace you with all my 
heart and I am forever your most affectionate
