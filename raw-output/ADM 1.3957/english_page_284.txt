some Representations, & while I
render them to you.
   The President of the Parliament has notified The Bishop since
two or three days ago, has since the Parliament, the
Chamber, the first Body having made
Remonstrances against the Manifesto of
the [Prologe] of the Estates, of which the Remonstrances
were presented by the Parliament on the 14th May
of November. It was for having been the
Remonstrator of these three Pieces, which were
Reported as [Lefelles] by the
Parliament of Brittany, to serve the Memory
of the Exiles.
   All is then terminated then in Brittany;
And we Hope that if the King and the Council of
State do not torment themselves in Manners,
The Rumor runs that the Ministry wants
to heat up the Estates and the Parliament; the Duke
of Duras who submits to it, and who does not want
this to happen without his sole Counsel,
does not want to go nearly to the Estates; They
pretexted that the Spirit of the privilege of which
the [Jetteurs] does not want to return there. One
enters there freely and suffices in. The King desires
and that this be thus in silence, or he calls it
is present, and as long as time
can make the laws heard in King the
of the Throne.
