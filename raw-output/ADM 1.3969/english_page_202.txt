                    Paris the 18th August 1783.

         There is much talk of a
Conference that would have taken place between
M de Vergennes, and Mr Markoff,
Minister of Russia, in which the
Latter showed much ill humor
and Mme Vergennes much [fond-
froid] and firmness. One would like that
Mr de Markoff had gone to Mme
Vergennes's, to thank her for the Care
one had for his Subject, and justify
the Composition of a Letter dated
from Riga, that one saw in the Gazette
of Leyden of June 11, 30, and [alquelle]
Mr Markoff does not deceive our
Ministers.

         Mr de Verac, Minister of the King
in Prussia, has obtained Permission
to return to France. One will not fail
to spread Rumors about this
Return; it say that he has been recalled.
