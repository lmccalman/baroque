N°. 29.

                    Paris the 29th July 1776.

                         A Letter from Toulon,
dated the 11th, says that the Chevalier d'Appernonese,
commanding the Squadron, being able
only to pass by the Isle Marie of the Princes and
to [Sirilane], as he had received
from Mr Turgoth, did not judge it appropriate,
[a un de l'Isle de France le Commissaire
arrêter]: he passed into the
East Indies [d'Esa Cantre], and took on
Provisions there.
     I am led to hope for the Destination
of the Squadron, commanded by Mr
Bestion. These Two Vessels have
departed.
     There is still talk of the affair
of the Portuguese against the Spanish;
but this News is not confirmed,
it is regarded today
as false.
