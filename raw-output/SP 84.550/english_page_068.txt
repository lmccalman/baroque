Paris this 2nd February 1776

Our letters from Toulon
and from Brest have brought us
interesting announcements:
If Fregetta was going to depart
from Toulon to go disarm
at Brest, or return to the Port
of Ferrol.
It is announced Paris one must
assemble three last at the Palace
on different Markets of the
[Medeine]. The Prince of Conti,
who presides the Marshal [d'hy] was
found. There was the difficulty of
[Roquelay] assemblies, that this
Prince [Maffey] was momentarily
imprisoned at the Bastille - It is
thought that this is one of the minds
are of the assassination of Rogues,
First President of a promised
at least.
