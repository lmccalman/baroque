exactness as speed. His Majesty would have seen at the same
time, with much satisfaction, that the Order of the Clergy
in said States, would have refused to adopt said Memoir,
& to consent to the printing & distribution thereof; a
conduct so wise would have appeared to His Majesty all the more

conveying to him their final representations, if they had
