Paris, July 4, 1812

You will read in our
Newspapers to Mr Provences, by what
[debilité] that the Emperor intends
to put the Frontiers safe
from all Insult, that he was not thinking
of attacking the Turks and that this
News had given the greatest
Pleasure to our Court. There then is
the war suspended, for it is
not probable that the Emperor of
Russia would want at once, to fight against
us and have how it arranges itself
with the Porte for the Peace of
Bosphorus of Crimea. But all
that is not yet verified, and
perhaps is only to
amuse us. We must see.

Madame Vaudreuil has not yet
appeared at Court. He is flown to
Egmatt, occupied with her Interrogations
before the Council of Marine, and
other Objects, as well as

                                        Signatures.
