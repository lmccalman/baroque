last Sunday the Minister's Response:
returned Tuesday to Versailles, to
receive there the King of Sweden, who finally
left Sunday. The Prince departs
today or Tomorrow.
     The King gave him as a Present the Principal
Images of the Gobelins Tapestries,
the most beautiful that could be found,
a complete Service in Sèvres Porcelain
Manufacture of the Chapel and one hundred
Copies of the Tapestries.
     The Count of Maillebois had requested
a particular [Frederns] from the King, which
was refused to him; he left to
retire to [his] land near Melun, where [ils

drowned women and many [Herits]
of Paris.

will concern affairs that are not
proper to it, and even less than others
