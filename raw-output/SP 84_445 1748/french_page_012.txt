emerged to the last Point excepting Unshaken, who
has now given it to the State, and as to the office a
Pleas all the Towns would readily come into it were
Unshaken to yield, and I will venture to say that if
the States had at first come into these two Aims the
People would have given them no disturbance upon
the offer of Taxes.

And indeed, without prejudging in the least to
justify the late riotous proceedings, I cannot help
owning that the People are so far in the Right in this
Demand, that hitherto in most towns the income of
the Port office has been made private property, in so
much that in one family all Canada down thethrough
and Northern part is known to produce near 3000 pounds
sterling per annum.

As to the Pleas, the rige of the People in this
head is owing to the shameful manner in which the
magistrates have in hand to themselves their children
