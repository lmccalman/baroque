A part of the crews of His
Imperial Majesty has also
arrived in this City. In short,
appearances announce a
war; while everywhere one
speaks only of peace.

I am assured that they have
put workers back, to finish
demolishing the fortifications of Ath,
as well as those of Namur, and
even of the Citadel. There is a
riddle to solve.

Fire broke out, a few
days ago, at the magazines of Ath, but
it was extinguished instantly.
Arsonists are suspected.
