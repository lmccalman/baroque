Mister Secret Counselor to the King
We take the liberty of informing you of an important matter which concerns us & which also interests the service of the King. We are all six of the same family & descendants of Guillaume Bourdillon who had the honor of being Secret Counselor to the King & Grand Provost of the household & of the King's Household. We pray you to do us the honor of granting us your protection in this matter which is of the greatest consequence for us. It concerns asserting our rights over considerable properties which belong to us legitimately, & of which we are unjustly deprived. We hope that you will be willing to take knowledge of our titles & help us with your credit & your authority to have justice rendered. We very humbly beseech you to be willing to honor us with a favorable response, & we have the honor of being with profound respect
