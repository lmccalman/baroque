Rotterdam 27th January 1775.

My Lord

I have had the honour to answer
your Lordships Letter of the 23d Currt.
Saturday, & this morning
I have only to say, that about five or Six
embarked the 25th of British Ships which
have arrived at, and sailed out of the
River here and Swede in the Course
of the last year.
They all have failed from hence
last year for St Eustatius, but in case
of a War, that Island would have been
the staple for supplying the Americans
in their American Traffick from.
The State of the Rivers of Land Rhune
is still alarming, and as the frost is
going off, much damage & incon-
venience, will be felt by the Carrying on much
of the high Wind of last Sunday, the
Obstructions occasioned by the Ice in
these Rivers, has given Way, to Sunday
last inclusive, by dint of Raisul Winds
& other temporary Means, thirty
one upon the Point of giving Way,
time been preserved.

The

To the Earl of Halifax.
