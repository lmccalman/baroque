The Dean of the Princes de Beauveau causes great
Sensation, the Peers who have embraced the Party
of the Princes, will not be Suspected of being com-
plices of the Prince de Beauveau, even when
the Affair will be judged. They returned Saturday
Evening from La grienne, scarcely had Mr de Beauveau
entered, when it was learned by the Duke de la Vrilliere and
entered, and handed him a Packet, for which he demanded
a Receipt, which was granted. It is believed that in
this Packet was the Letter from Mr le Duc in these terms.

"Sir, I have Received the King's Order through the Minister
to write to [Me], and feeling myself Submissive, I cannot
send you enough the my orders joined to
that of Toulouse, and becoming received the
useless, for Languedoc, I have charged another
with the Command of [Sites] Provinces;
but your Zeal and your Attachment for
my Person being known to me, I am charged to
continue to you the Command of the troops
of your charge, my Intention is that the
troops of my troops of the Corps not be
charged with anything else, because the one that there is
the Service is sufficient to lack. On this Low."

The Prince de Beauveau wrote Immediately
to the Swiss Regiment which is said to be [rende] Beauty.

The Count de Brionne named Commander
for Languedoc, and particularly of the Posts
charged with the King's orders for those of the Parlements.
