Madrid the 10th July 1782.

On the 22nd of the Current departed
from Cartagena the Expedition against
Algiers, consisting of 56 Sails both
large and small Vessels under
the Orders of Mr Barcelo; that one does not
doubt here of the Success, provided that
the weather favors him.

It is reported from Toulon that
several Ships of the
line are held ready there for an Expedition; this
Fleet must combine with one
to act in concert with a strong
Squadron that is held ready at Cadiz,
so it is said.

General O. Reily, has returned
to Cadix, and Don Louis de Cordova
has taken Leave of the Court, to
return to his Department.

Our National Bank
