versement of the money of the kingdom into other foreign Lotteries;
from which results a sensible prejudice for the State, & which merits
all the more the attention of His Majesty, as the amount, according to
certain information, forms a considerable object, & which could
only increase in the future by the different chances that
neighboring States will seek to put into these sorts of games; He would have
judged that prohibition could not be employed against the inconveniences
of this nature, there could be no other remedy than
to procure for his subjects a new Lottery of which the different games,
in presenting to them the hazards which they wish to seek, be capable
of satisfying & fixing their taste. Consequently, His Majesty would have
had examined by the persons most versed in this kind, the
project of a Lottery in which several chances have been added

& public & useful Establishments, to which said
Lotteries have been conceded, the [récouis] which they draw from them. To this
effect, the intention of His Majesty is to assure to each of them, for
the time of their concession, the amount of the net product which they
have drawn from it, such as it will be found established on the statement of the ten
