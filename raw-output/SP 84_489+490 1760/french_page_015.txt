     I find that Marshal Soult
had made Preparations at the Audience of
the Nation on or before, and by his
second recounnoitre the Sides of the
Stage being raised, that a meal too
or three Days last, it is now would
have been Sung at Paris, and a
general Illumination through the
Town, orders having been Signed
for that Purpose.

I have the Honor to be with the greatest
Respect

     Mylord

          Your Lordship's
               Most obedient
                    Humble Servant
