Rennes the 6th September 1782.

        The Public Papers will
have informed you that the Russians have occupied
Crimea, & Kuban and [Crête de Tamar].
The Armaments of the Turks are not going any
faster, and the Russians are preparing for
a Winter Campaign; the Imperial
Troops are equally in movement
and marching to the frontiers of
Turkey, thus the Emperor is beginning
to lose [les nerots de loulées]. The
peaceful manners, in order to force them
into Hostilities, and thereby have a
plausible pretext to attack them.
        The Turks have assembled One Hundred Thousand
men in Asia, and this Army
marching through Georgia, advances toward
the Shores of the Black Sea. It is reckoned
therefore at this Moment that there have
already been two gunshots fired, and
Heads cut off; for Prince Repnin
has orders to march to Adrianople
with a Corps of Thirty Thousand Men
