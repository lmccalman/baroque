My Lord Duke

the whole Confession of monsieur de l'isle
lay on me and on my Father and was by all
this that I could hear was no doubt given.
and now by time Peace and Repose if anything could make
him so happy as may be to wish to live any days as a private
gentleman and to say the least that he can say of the 
miseries my whole and my families have been in since that unhappy
affair in france and the unfortunate loss of my wife be most grievous
things indeed yet I have still was able to say that I can forgive
him as I would do to the worst of my enemies to beleive all that
be said and to beg of his assistance as to the time which may
be so hard yet to do.
