to have much trouble before a good suit of clothes
is worn out although the people who go to the hospital
are quite happy to leave it to no longer have any
bad ones but it is not so with us others who always
have the black suit on our shoulders and this is only a
small sample of the cares and worries that
a suit inspires in us however beautiful it may be and yet this
same suit has value only by the occasions where it can
do us honor if it were not for the circumstances when
one goes into company or when one must appear
at assemblies and spectacles there would only be the necessary
which would be quite easy to find and at least to
cover oneself one would only need what can protect from the cold
but as man carries his desires further than
his needs it follows that he wants to have good clothes
for the occasions where propriety requires it
