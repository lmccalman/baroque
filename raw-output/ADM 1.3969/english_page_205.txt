Genoa, and Naples, which are assured
to be destined to take Part in
this Expedition.

The Duke Chaulnes de Ligne,
Three Bishops, The two Orders of
Don Stormont, have for Four
Months of Provisions, which puzzles

There are Intrigues and
Cabals in our Ministry;
Mr de Blanc who has just brought back
the greater part of the King's Squadron
to Cabit, and Mr de Cagnoli, Land
Officer, have been arrested at Calais,
by Order of the Court, on an
Accusation brought against Them,
by Don Bernard de Galvez, Nephew
of the Minister of the Indies. The said Gentlemen
loudly demand to be judged,
and that their Accuser upon his arrival
be equally arrested, and judged
like Them.
