Rotterdam the 29th March 1771


Milord


I Am Deeply moved that through Your
Your Solicitation His Majesty has Been Willing to
increase the Salary of Your Clerk, it is
a great Relief for a man who has
Such a numerous family.

Permit me to show You my Sincere
and Lively Gratitude for it, I do not doubt that
this gratification which he owes to your generous Care
[ni] carries him to redouble his Zeal in the affairs
which are Entrusted to him. As for me, Milord, I will
not Cease to make Wishes for Your Preservation
and Your Happiness, permit me to recommend myself
as well as my daughters in the Continuation
of Your Benevolence.

I have the honor to be with profound Respect

Milord

Your very humble and very
obedient Servant
M. Wollens
