Scr-

I am just returned from Zealend by
His Royal Highness the Duke's Leave.
I am informed that the French have laid
an Embargo on all the Dutch Ships that are
in the River of Charente, which in my opinion
is done to prevent their giving any intelligence
of what is doing at Rochelle, the departing
of the Fleet for America, being part of confining
me in my opinion, that part of this Fleet is
designed for some other purpose.

I am by mt Trevor's orders making a strict
inquiry about any suspected persons that may
come to this town, and you may depend that
I shall discharge my Duty in this affair with
all possible Diligence and secrecy.

I have the honor to be &

                                        Sir
                                        Your most humble
Rott July 3d not 1780                   & most obedient servt
                                        R.W. Otters
