OBSERVATIONS.

THE Parliament of Franche-Comté was formerly composed of sixty Members, not including the King's Men.

The new Edict reduces this Body to forty-one, not including the King's Men.

Its formation was done in three days, & it is composed of three Honorary Counselors of the old Parliament:

Twenty-eight Presidents as well as Counselors of the old Parliament:

Five other persons taken from the order of Lawyers, of which two are sons of Counselors. Another who had purchased an Office of Counselor. Another who had purchased an Office of Attorney General. The fifth is related to the greater part of the Gentlemen of Parliament.

One sees from this table that there are now only five Counselor positions to appoint. Many persons present themselves all suited to occupy them, as much by their merit as by their birth.
