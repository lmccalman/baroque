                   The Letters from Toulon
           of the 19th announce nothing.
                Those from Brest of the 22nd assure, that the
           Prussian Corsairs continue their successes;
           it has been decided, that [moi] & up to M.r of
           troops had moved back this Vessel, to
           facilitate there the Brillant, which is straight in
           [Ele] to do it in the grand [Voy egye].
                One was counting much on this Vessel
           for Dieppe, & one was waiting at Havre de
           grace for the Bordeaux, & it will be [morte],
           I was today Grenoble. One sent the 21
           [D'Herculie] to the [Langue], & four parts of
           [trouvés] of students in the Magazines
           for this operation.
                The Navy has even recognized [Ed] to
           in various Regiments to do to all
           the King's Vessels; but in [ga]
           lack of Wood, to do the
           Repairs.
                The [Boulons] always well, that not
           will arrive 26 Vessels in our Ports,
           but the letters from Brest do not [appartient] not.
