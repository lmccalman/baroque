Rotterdam this 7th April 1749

Sir

I [agréer occuper] the letter that I received from [madamephère]
notwithstanding the arrival of Mylord Malmsbury in this country
Monsieur Blake found according to him according to the arrangements
not the hundred pounds sterling obtained per quarter to be
shared between him his son and Ranman; after which time
by the orders of Mylord Malmsbury this money will be received
at Monsieur Crawford's here here Monsieur Blake was to receive
in advance the quarter on the 25th of last month; but
some days ago Monsieur Blake received a note from
Monsieur Crawford in which he informs him that there
exists no order from Mylord to discontinue the
payment of this sum so that Monsieur Cammy
was surprised that this quarter was not paid, the brother of
Monsieur Crawford the one who ordinarily resides
in Rotterdam having left for England, the one who
is currently [there], believes that his brother neglected to
inform him of this order before his departure. Monsieur Blake
responded that he had received no notice to deprive him
[nec du un changement dans la façon de luy qu'intiens]
