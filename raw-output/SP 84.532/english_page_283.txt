Deputies that the people are renewed, learned,
poorly received; because then these Remonstrances
are public, and that they are a religious
respect that one holds with the Parlements.
One can only compare the whole. In
this Sovereign Court, they hear that one
has done have had so much good service.

The Parlement of Aix has written to the King
some Days ago; that of Besançon
has sent Remonstrances. All the
Parlements awaken as soon as one touches
me the King has all; and that the cry before
Parlement has only done what it had
to do. The King responds to none of
these Letters and these Remonstrances;
of State that they suppressed all, and reduces them,
in Councils all less [valeurents] of the
Parlement of Paris, under the King himself.
One wants only one State in France
and the King only one Parlement, as
there is only one.

The Dukes and the Peers are assembled
yesterday with the envoy of the King. M. the
D'Aubery than of Reims. One does not yet
know what one must do, nor what
one has decided.

The Reform of Men by companies
in the times of the King is very described.
