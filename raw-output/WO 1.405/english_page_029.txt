G.D. Atty    Copies of two letters from Paris dated 7 May.
             Couriers have arrived from Madrid on the 5th
             & 6th & 5th to our Cabinet purporting their uneasiness
             in case of a War. The King, Queen & Minister
             are uneasy for joining the Spaniards - but as
             yet it is not known what the determination of
             the national assembly may be.

             The commercial heads operating strong objections
             to the Board of Peace, and being filled to overflowing
             by every description of Persons, makes us very
             much inclined to believe that the National
             Assembly will comply with the repeated Solicitations
             of the King Queen & Catholic Minister to aid the
             views of Spain in order to secure their own
             preponderance.
