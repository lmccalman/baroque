Dunkirk, August 4, 1782.

     There is currently in the Roads
a Ship for the Coast of Guernsey
and from there to America. There will
soon be Two, which will depart for
the Islands.
     All the heavy Artillery has left
from this Port, so they say, for Brest.
     The Forts of Sucote, and Tortuques
are [lêver] at present to Private individuals
for Warehouses of the Smugglers;
the Munitions are transported
to Town.
     The King's Longue, is still
on the Shipyards, near the
Citadel.
     One speaks much here of a
Rupture between France and
the Emperor.
