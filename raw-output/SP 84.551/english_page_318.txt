Vienna the 25th September 1776.

The Court of Vienna

always jealous of the union which
currently reigned between the
Courts of Petersburg and Berlin,
it is seriously considering taking
identical Measures with
France; but as, in order to extricate
affairs from Bavaria, it would
be necessary to be able to count on
the [terme] of an able Minister,
and as these s[ame]
qualities are not attributed to Mr de Vergennes,
they continue the Justifications to
displace him, and they offer the Favor
of Stockenli at the head of Foreign
Affairs; I am even assured
since the day before yesterday, that this
Ambassador is going to depart from here
next Month for Paris,
                                                            and
