My Friend from Cadiz writes to me of the 17th
current, that a Visit of the [Infandani]
Don Joseph Galvez, has produced several
changes in the Royal Employees
at Vera Cruz, and other Places of
Mexico; where one has begun
to establish the new Contributions
from the Month of last March.
    The 9th of the Current there arrived from Cartagena
at Cadiz some Xebecs, which are conducting
in Garrison to Ceuta the Infantry
Regiment of the Princess.
