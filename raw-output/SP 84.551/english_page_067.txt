The day before yesterday they dispatched again
Two Couriers, one to Poland, and
the other to Prussia, and Silesia, in order to [leur
se] Report on what happened [lors]
Gentleman in Lisbon.
Soon we will know what
to make of it.

P.S. At this Moment a General
Officer has just told me, that
the Ambassador of Portugal,
had assured the King that the Court
was ready to give His Majesty
complete Satisfaction on
all the Vexations and Infractions
committed by the Troops in
America.
