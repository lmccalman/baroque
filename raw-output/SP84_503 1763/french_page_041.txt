he further assured me that I may depend
upon his giving me the earliest and best
accounts of their building and equipment.
I am very happy in this and every other
opportunity of giving your Lordship proofs
of my zeal for his Majesty's service.
I have the honour to be more respectfully
My Lord
your most humble
& most obedient servant
R L'Olton,
