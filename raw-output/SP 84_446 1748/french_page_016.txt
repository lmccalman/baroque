This very act of Prudence is the object of my
Proposition.

We all know the elections which have discovered
selves amongst the People of Amsterdam, and the conduct
of these factions, and none of us can pretend to be ignorant
there are murmurs of dissatisfaction in this City, and
not one of us, that is not sensible, that these murmurs must
out into an open mutiny, unless we most cordially agree to
prevent this evil by taking the Resolution of deferring any
ting the Mr Van Haerlem's Treaty project in this City to
regulate and dispose the Magistracy of this City so as we
think to be most conducive to the Peace of this City and
Citizens, and to the advantage of the Republick;
Were it not for these reasons proper to defer the Nomination
of Burgomasters?
