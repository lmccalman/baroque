It is reported from Madrid

on the 26th of last [month], that on the 20th said, the
order was received from Cartagena to
make the Armament leave from that

conducted by Don Sarralto, who

opposed by the Winds, He will not
be able to attempt anything against the
City.

The Letters from Marseilles of the
27th of the Current [month] state, that
[aventuriers] several Vessels
coming from Cartagena, which
report, that then [Sapart] on
its side was in expectation of an Embargo
