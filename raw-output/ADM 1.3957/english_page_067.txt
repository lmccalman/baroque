of our Navy up to the first Day
of the present year. You can count
on the Accuracy of this State, which must
be well distinguished from some others that
I have already communicated.

The Friend from whom I hold it, has promised
me to continue his Zeal to have for me the State of
our Vessels with Precision, but he
tells me that the Exactitude of their [Brodeur] makes

My Envoy indicates to me on the first
of the present Month the State in question, in which
no news makes him doubt, that they will not

said in the public and to Foreigners,
he informs me that I will be regularly
informed by Monsieur Farque the present

was happening there. I will receive with
Gratitude the Present that you
have permitted me to give him.
