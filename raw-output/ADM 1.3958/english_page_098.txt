                        Geneva the 20 February 1775.

                        I have not [written to] you at
all for some time, because all our
News consisted only of Conjectures,
which changed from hour to hour, According to the
Circumstances of the times.
        The News, the most disastrous that
we have received from France, assures,
that Peace is anything but infallibly
decided; the English Nations were not
content with the last Event and
[veulen entre les leurs] of France and
Madrid, and that in the Ports of France
they had no Order to cease
the Preparations for War: This is
nothing but what we will learn here.
        Since the Dissension that occurred
[en a eté tout faworong à Veoary], Their
troops which were there to the Number of
600 Men, entered into the Heart
of the Kingdom, and they were only replaced
by 50 Men and [Ambulance].
        They even affirm, that the [Cabid de Honne], and
the [Pole] will return as before to
this City.
                                                                        N.
