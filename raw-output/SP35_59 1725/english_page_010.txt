Gentleman of Bern, Privy Chamber, if this Title
had been included in a Letter of Credence, it would
surely be more honorable for me, especially in
a German Court. But you know better
than anyone what is appropriate to do
on this occasion and you have known my [ayures]
entirely for me you will always find
ready. it is to you Sir that I am [l'esy]
indebted for what I am.

The news that came this Evening by the Prussian
Post is contained in Paper N. 3.

I am with profound Respect

Sir


I was about to
close my Letters when I was brought
the enclosure from the Chancellery. It is
the Response to the Letter of Notification                Your very humble
that I presented.                                          and very obedient
did not have time to make a good                          Servant
Copy because of the rush of departure

Plantamour
