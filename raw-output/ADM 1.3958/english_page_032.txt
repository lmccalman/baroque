                        Madrid the 7th of January 1785.

                                    I am informed that the
King of France has been charged with settling the
disputes with England, and the couriers
are frequent from Paris, that one can
infer from this a Rupture with the [Sublimation]
of said King, and that they keep ready in the
Environs of Versailles, a Maneuver
opposite to the News of the Disgrace
of the Duke of Choiseul.

Despite all these Appearances, the
offensive and defensive Dispositions
continue with the same vigor.

I am written from Aragon and from Alicante
dated I know not which, that
Charles 3 King of Spain, has
English studied at the Antilles to the
[potaillons] of the Regiment of Flanders,
and one of Murcia.

I am written from Ferrol, that 15 Ships
of the Line find themselves ready to set Sail
under the Orders of Arana, and that they continue
to arm the Rest of the Ships
in the six Ports. They had launched
into the Water a new Ship of 74
Cannons.
