Our National Bank is gaining
more Consistency every Day.
The day before yesterday, by order
of the Court, five Million in Jewels
from the Succession of our late Monarch
were deposited there, and it will do
the same with all Deposits to be
made in the future.
   For the Rest, people flatter themselves here, that the
Workers, will carry themselves with good
grace, to the Intention, and will of the
King, by admitting among them,
the establishment of Royal Alliances,
Royal Garrison, and
the Tobacco Sign, for the Account
of His Majesty, as throughout
all Spain, without them being covered
to the point of losing all their Commune
that one would [attenteroit] to the [Rois] of
St Andrew. We shall see.
