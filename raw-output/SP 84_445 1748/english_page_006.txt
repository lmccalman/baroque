My Lord Duke_

Since the letter that I had the honor to
write to your grace the 8 instant the Commotion
in this Province have increased to such a point
that last Wednesday it was thought adviseable to
keep them in the longer any succours from the Duke
of Orange, who was that day carried to the assembly
of Holland where a new Placid was inserted, which
was published here yesterday and I engaged to have it had again upon the mind of the People,
and I hope that it will have of the others of them
published upon the 10th instant, which I must own
was not wanted earnestly to be repeated to the People
who validate(?) found out that the Prince of Orange
had had no hand in it. All this proceed to this

Government

H: grace the Duke of Bedford_                    13
