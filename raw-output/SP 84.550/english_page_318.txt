The Marshal de Richelieu
was brought forward yesterday to the regular tribunal
of the Palace, before the
Reporting Counselor of his
affair, which was continued
until by [faiblegement].

The Promotion of General
Officers that was expected,
will take place only in the Month
of October.

The Prince de Conti is still
dying.

Nothing interesting has been
received from our Ports, nor from Orleans.
