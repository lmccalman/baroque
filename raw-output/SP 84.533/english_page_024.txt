There is talk of several Edicts which are
in Parliament, and which should appear
this Week.

The rumor runs, that in the Number
of these Edicts, there is one, which will impose a tax
on Bachelors, people only laugh at it
and one could not imagine better. Nothing
is full of old bachelors [lichés] etc.
The Garden, and quite able to pay.

The Parliament is working on Remonstrances
on the Subject of the Edict, which imposes a tax
on [Rellerges] acquired since 1745, and
against the advice/project/plan of the King to retain it.

Joined to these Remonstrances an article
concerning the funds to be paid to
Lawyers, contained in a Declaration
which has been put to the Examination of Commissioners.

The Nine or Ten Lawyers who composed
the Queen's Council have returned there, with
[d'Melles Lignes et Appointments charges/m']
having [l'avis] of the spirit of their Body, have been
Dismissed by an express Order of the King.

The News of the Returns, which add the
Gazettes in France and everywhere, [lors le Rélé-
ve/ue de Ras de la Congregation de la Cause], the
Uprising, in it will be found only more brilliant.
