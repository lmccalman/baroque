She was no sooner there, than She declared
wanting at the head of her Troops to oppose a
force, not, said She, to the Assembly of
States, but to the People who had Risen in
the Capital, nothing was ready at the Palace,
as had been predicted to her. The Officer
of the Guard having arrived, the Empress
ordered him to have announced by
trumpet or the accustomed Manner,
namely, that from the Ropewalk, from the Citadel &c,
one fire 400. Cannon Shots; it was then
one Hour after Midnight. This terrible
Cannonade awoke all Petersburg; and
those who were not yet in bed,
could no longer become Departed from their
Houses, or not, because the Sentiment
most general was that there was some
Revolution at the Palace. All the Officers
and the Guards ran there, and one was
soon informed of the Presence of the
Sovereign and all was calmed.
    The Stay of the Court put some
times of the Sorrow of the Empress.
She has found there more Means of
Dissipation than She had in the
                                        Country.
