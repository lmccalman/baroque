                    Paris the 30th March 1775.

                                        It is reported from Toulon
that there has been an order to stop the works
of the Arsenal, and to dismiss all the
extraordinary workers.
        It is also reported that from this Department
arrived yesterday in Paris; one will know today
if he has ordered the same orders at Brest
and at Rochefort.
        People are very surely occupied in finding
Means to establish an East India
Company.
        It appears quite that it will be of interest
in the famous bank that the Chancellor
is hoping to make to the Parliament; one will
await the return on the 9th of this Month, for
the [hôtellution] of the new Parliament:
Which would present more People
than necessary to compose the 60 Members
of which it will be composed, one already sees the
Names posted on the doors of all the
Members of the old Parliament, to
form the list of the New ones; there are
for that open Registers, where it will be done
If one will be able to Restore them to their old
Principles, and they will not follow the Same
on the part of the Professors.
                                                        end.
