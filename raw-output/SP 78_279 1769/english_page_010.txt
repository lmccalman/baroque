The pleasure or rather the affair in very great at least nothing
happens to little near and I don't know why, Madame
de Berg Ops Zoom came to The Hague, I don't know what she does and
all the voyage that she must make this year. Monsieur
de Benninck (do you believe that?) is always doing well and better
at the approach of Paris; the attraction of the abbé de Polignac is very
great and with what joy! The news that you give me
from time to time are very pleasant for you and your
recovery. However one must always fear
relapses, and I beg you not to put yourself in
the position of running the risks of them. I have received with much
pleasure news of Monsieur the Count de Calncy, and am
charmed that he is happy with Madame his wife. The
return of the Countess du Luc and what she told you about
me have extremely flattered me. I thank you for your
kindnesses for the Young person. I am very glad
that they gave her reason, she deserved it. I
beg you to thank her for the compliments she made me and
to make them to her on my behalf.

The Postillion is leaving and I must finish despite the pleasure
I would have in continuing. Farewell, My very dear friend, I
embrace you with all my heart and am for life with
a true and sincere friendship to you.
