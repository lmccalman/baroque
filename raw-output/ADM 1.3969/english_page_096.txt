Dunkirk the 24 May 1780.

They are currently occupied
here with arming the Corsairs to
send them to the Islands, and to America,
with Merchandise.

There is still one on the Shipyards
near the Bridge of the Citadel, of
2 to 3 Hundred Tons.

There is much talk of having
some Luggers built, for
account of the King.

They are not yet working at the
Port, nor at the Fortifications of the
Town. However the general idea
here, is, that this Port will be restored.
