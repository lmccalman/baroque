Rotterdam 29th March 1773.

My Lord

It would be a great Convenience of Duty,
if I may be admitted to pay my Respects to
your Lordship in Person, and more Respectfully
to thank you for the signal Honor of this
additional Mark of Confidence of £20. per annum.
Mr Sutton writes me, that your Lordship is
pleased also to speak to Lord Sandwich
for an additional £50. per annum as Consul
Admiralty, and I flatter my Self that
your Lordship's powerful Interest of You
will have the desired Success, the Service
and Duty with which I serve His Majesty
are correspondent to the late Mr. Suttons.
These Marks of your Lordship's high
Protection, must lay me under the
strongest Obligations in Times of Peace
in the like Occasions.
I shall not intrude upon your Lordship's
Time, by many Words and Protestations of
my Gratitude, but I trust your Lordship
endeavour as much as is in my Power, and to
the Extent of my Small Capacity, to shew that
I am sensible of these favours conferred on my Respects
and am worthy of them.
I have the Honour to be most Respectfully
My Lord
your Lordship's
most Humble and most
obedient Servant
J.D. Hake.

Right Earl of Halifax.
