141.            R 13 August No. 7

                    Extract
              from a letter from
              Germany.

Polish Prussia is decidedly
ceded to the King of Prussia; with the exception
of the Cities of Danzig and Thorn;
which the interested Powers have
not wished to leave him; but which
cannot escape him. The City
of Elbing has consented to receive
a Prussian Garrison, and the orders
are already given to arrange
things on a new Footing
in that Country.

This Arrangement appears to be
a great step toward
Peace, which is hoped to be settled.
