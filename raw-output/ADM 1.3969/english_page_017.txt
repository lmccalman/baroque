expenses by sieur Gibb & his Associates; this is my hope
and the object of this Memoir.

The Corsair the Lively stopped the Ship the Holland;
& I who was a Passenger on it, in violation of national
conventions, I am owed compensation proportionate
to the consequences of this unjust hostility.

I will not dwell on the details of what was taken from me
on board; this enumeration would not be worthy of the attention
of the Lords of the Admiralty, & they know the customs. A
Corsair Captain said to a Dutch Prisoner, while
removing his shirt: the English are most generous Enemies
of the World. The English are the most generous Enemies
of the World: but the expenses of my stay in England,
& of my voyage from Mevagissey, & from Falmouth
to London, from London to Ostend, & from Ostend to Paris,
are a considerable matter.

In examining these different causes for indemnity; I do
not believe I ask too much, in demanding that sieur Gibb
& his Associates, who refused to submit to Arbitrators,
as I had offered them through my protestations,
be condemned in my favor, to compensation of
one thousand Guineas; but what compensation will they pay me
for the risk they made me run of losing my life on
a foreign & barbarous coast, & for all the troubles
they made me suffer, in contempt of the law of nations, & of
their own conventions, to a man who has never made
hostile moves against any Nation, & whose peaceful
state has no other object than civil security.
