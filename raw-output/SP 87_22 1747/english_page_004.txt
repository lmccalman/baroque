Bedarrides et Bauvet the 9 June.
                                1747.

My Lord.                                317

                I have been honored by two
letters from your Lordship of the 19th 22d
inst: to of which I shall make the best
use I can towards procuring a settle-
ment, as to Mr Wallers services & expe-
rience, by acquainting his Royal
Highness with your thoughts upon
the subject, which I am sure will have
weight to determine them than any
thing else could have, the chief difficulty
as far as I can perceive, is to know what
has been customary in the like case.

I am sorry to give your Lordship so
much trouble, as I am sincerely & with
the utmost respect

                My Lord Your most obedient
                & devoted humble Servant
                Everard Fawkener
