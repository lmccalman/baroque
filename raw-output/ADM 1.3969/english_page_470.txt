It is believed that Cavalier Emo has gone
to bombard some places of the regency.

The court has finally received news
of the arrival of the squadron of Midianitide,
on September 25 at Constantinople, after
a voyage of four months and 17 days.
The rumor is circulating here that the king's
vessel the Septentrion of 74 cannons was
lost on a shoal, near Malaga;
as the soldiers [s'en agerent], and
made use of the new cannons of the
carronade; that after this term they
gave them their [barravage]; there are currently
more than a third of our army in
this situation; which means that we no longer
know what to do, to fill the void
everyone being disgusted with the service.

Our Infant Don Charles is dead.
There is much fear for Don Ferdinand,
the only Infant remaining to us. The Infanta
Dona Marie Amelie is also ill.
