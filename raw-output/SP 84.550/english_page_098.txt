Second

Madrid, February 29, 1776.

The Naval Officers
who had absconded on Leave, have
received orders to return
immediately to their
respective Departments.
It is not doubtful that
12 to 14 Ships as well as
Frigates are being armed for Spring;
but with all that, one flatters
oneself that there will be no more expedition,
and that it is only as a precaution,
to be ready if needed, for any
eventuality.
For some Days it has been
observed that our Ministers have
frequent Assemblies at
Pardo.
