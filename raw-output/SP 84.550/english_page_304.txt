N° 19

Paris the 14th of June 1776

The Measles of the
Count of Artois has broken out in spots, and these
bad kinds, accompanied by
petechiae; they have sent for the Baths.
Yesterday this Prince was at his Toilette when one
can be worried about his State. Many
people claimed that it is Small-
Pox; if someone of this blood carried in his
house the germ of Disease, she would
not provide remedies, the Evil of the Sick.

Madame Elisabeth had
fever and they feared that it might be
a similar Disease; but She is
cured and left last Friday
for Marly; the Court will return Monday
to Marly. The Duke of Angoulême
was taken to Trianon.

The Count of Maurepas is the
only Minister who is at Marly; the
others are in Paris or at Versailles.

There will not be this year
any Journey either to Compiègne, or to
Fontainebleau,
