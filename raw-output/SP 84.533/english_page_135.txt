still ordered them to remain in Session. The Clerk then read the Edict of suppression, &
after this reading & the publication, M. the Marshal
had the Clerk distribute to all the Presidents
& Councillors another letter of cachet which ordered
them to leave the Palace, to return to their
residence, to remain there until further notice & to receive
no one. After this distribution each person
withdrew, & M. the Marshal, M. de Ballard, the King's
Men & the Clerk remained at the Palace to register
the Edict & draw up official report of all that
had passed at said session; these Gentlemen did not leave
until half past one in the afternoon. At two o'clock
of the same day, they began to distribute to thirty
Members of the Parlement new letters of
cachet, which sent them each to their Lands,
& ordered them to leave the City before nightfall.
This order was executed.

On Tuesday the 6th, the Major Officers of the Place went
in the morning to all the Presidents & Councillors
who had not been exiled, & announced to
them that the order which had kept them at home since
the day before, was lifted; the rest of this day presented
nothing new, nor the following day;
but on Thursday the 8th at ten o'clock M. the Marshal & M. de
Ballard entered the Palace, the Members who composed
the new Parlement went there at the same
hour; M. Chifflet who had been appointed by the King to
the position of First President, had taken the day before the
oath in the hands of M. the Marshal, & after
the customary things in such a case, they opened the doors
of the Palace, & the Edict of creation was read, published &
registered.
