One should not I believe, this Minister not
establish order in the Finances, &
he is treated too hastily. It is that he has not
yet many operations.

They are going to strike Coins of Gold & Silver
for the King's Account: he will have funds
come out the most, instead of really Paying
at Paris.

Certainly much
[Bruin] arrives in various Ports, but what has it
to greatly influence Prices.

There are many Provinces where the Harvests
notable, the Vines are always without
promise of excess, this winter was feared,
and Spring.

They still speak of the affair of the Duke
d'Aiguillon, between the small Memoir
signed by Twelve Lawyers that this Duke has
had printed, he has had printed a
more extended and detailed Memoir, which he
submitted to his Judges. This Affair is
all the 29th at Versailles. One does not doubt
that the King will smother this whole
Affair by a flat letter, but of which
all the World that is employed there, has
seen advised.
