Rotterdam x^ber 17 1862

Sir-

I have to acknowledge the honour of
General Conway's letter of the 24 past-
enclosing his Majesty's speech.
I have also received from the office the
addresses by the mail of the 25.
The enclosed Geneva production which I
that may wish be unacceptable to General
Conway, I shall occasionally endeavour to
collect all the papers relating to their affairs.
