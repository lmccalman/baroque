Paris the 30th January 1784

     Nothing at all interesting
is happening, neither at the Court, nor
in the City.

     They have deferred or Suspended
the exportation of Grain from the Ports
of Provence until it can be
judged whether it will bring any
concern for the provisioning
of the Kingdom.

     The aerostatic Machine of
Lyon did not have all the Success
that one had flattered oneself with.

     The Poor of this Kingdom,
suffer greatly from the severity
of the Season.
