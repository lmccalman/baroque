Different Letters from Barcelona
report, that Don Nicolas de Rieux,
[Sugo] sent by the King to examine
in cold blood the Affair of the Ten Thousand Turks,
destined for America, having
discovered a horrible Conspiracy,
after having had different
Master Armorers arrested, as well as the
Fiscal, the Assessor, and the Notary,
who had been involved in this
Case, by placing the Sequester
on their Goods, had himself been
surprised by his imprudence,
& Defendant of Catalonia,
Mr. Castannos, Father-in-Law of Mr.
d'Aguilley, by relegating him to
the Forges in the Indies, so it is said.
This Affair was making much
Noise. Misfortune to these [Homibles]
who had been sent to America
have been sent back, as of no
Service, [?]several Soldiers having
been wounded by them, as well as [il
cadis].
