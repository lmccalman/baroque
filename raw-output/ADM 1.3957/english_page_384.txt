St. Ildefonse, September 19, 1779.

I am written that the two
Regiments of Victoires and Bourbon have
Orders to go to Galicia, to
embark there at Ferrol for America.
They do not specify the fixed day of their
Destination.
     General O'Reilly, named Inspector
General of all the Troops and Militias
of America, must return there shortly
to his Destination.
     Since the Reception of the News of
the Expedition made from Buenos Ayres
upon the Island fortress of the English,
of which I spoke to you, they fear some
[Pointes] of Galicia.
     I have not yet been able to form my [Luisisons]
in the principal Ports of the Monarchy,
but I am made to hope that soon
this will take place.
