Whitehall, March 22d 1771.

Mrs Walters.                    Madam,

                    I am very glad to
acquaint You, that the King has
been pleased graciously to consider
the Circumstances of Mr Rake's
Situation, and to grant an
Addition of £40. p Year to his
Salary from my Department. You
are therefore, for the future, to
charge in your Quarterly Bills
£25, instead of £15, for the Salary
of your Clerk.

                    I am &c.
                         North Halifax
