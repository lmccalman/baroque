                    Madrid the 19th July 1770.

                                    Until this moment
I have absolutely nothing new to
report to you, because I have not yet been able to confirm
anything somewhat substantial. I am
promised a new Envoy, whose
Effect I await.
        In the meantime, I can inform you,
that aside from a few Escort Vessels,
there are no Outfittings in
the Ports of Spain; and Money is
anything but abundant in the treasury.
        I am written to from Cadiz, that the fleet
from Vera Cruz will bring 39 Million
Piastres, of which 35 for Commerce,
and 4 for the King.
