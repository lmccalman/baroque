N°868.

Paris the 2nd August 1776.

The Letter from Brest
from the last Ordinary, have said nothing
more, than what was previously
reported from it.

That from Toulon of the 24th July
says, that the works of the Port
are delayed.

The Duke of Aiguillon, Chief of
solicitations, has obtained Permission
to appear at Court, and to perform
his service there as Commander of
the Light Horse; but it is not
believed that he will reenter the Ministry.

The State of Orders, and that
of Corvées, are given without
Communication to the Parliament;
they want to make Changes,
they even want to establish the Horses
as they were before.
