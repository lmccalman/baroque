wishing to repress such condemnable excesses; THE KING
BEING IN HIS COUNCIL, has suppressed & suppresses said
Memoir, having for title: Response of the Estates of Brittany to the
Memoir of the Duke of Aiguillon, as containing principles

calumnious & injurious, concerning a person honored by the
confidence of His Majesty, & whose administration He has at all times
approved: His Majesty has likewise sup-
pressed & suppresses said deliberation of 21 December 1770;
orders that it shall be erased & struck out on the registers of said
Estates, & that the present decree shall be transcribed in the margin thereof:
Makes prohibitions to said Estates, under such penalty as shall be fitting,
to make such Memoirs, & to take in the future
similar deliberations: His Majesty likewise makes pro-
hibitions to all Printers, to reprint, & to all Ped-
dlers & others, to distribute said Memoir, under penalty of
corporal punishment: And the present decree shall be printed, published
& posted wherever necessary, so that no one
may be ignorant of it. DONE in the Council of State of the King, His Majesty being present,
held at Versailles the second of January one thousand seven hundred seventy-one.
