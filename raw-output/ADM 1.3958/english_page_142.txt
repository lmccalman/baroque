They are always talking about sending 8. Brigades
and 7. Frigates for Evolutions.
They have not yet sent the 3
frigates, to carry to our Colonies
the Certainty of Peace.
The troops are not moving from here;
they say it is for the works.
M.r de Quivy is leaving for P.t.le de France
as Intendant, in the Place of M.r Poivre
who is recalled.
M.r Marchais is leaving, to go
request a Position as Commissaire
Ordonnateur elsewhere, he does not fit
with our new Intendant.
