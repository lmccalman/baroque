" present, than to enlighten Your Majesty, we only wish to [interdire]
" the goodness of his heart.
   It is dreadful to all the Members of your Parlement to have
" had the misfortune of displeasing Your Majesty; but, Sire, who
" can judge of affliction & better they & for them, & upon whom
" are going to influence & upon the public good & upon the interest of your service*, of the
" [à s'il n'importe]? The one [teroce] of so many new punishments,
" destructive of these Laws which assured for so long the happiness
" & the tranquility of France, will they become a source of
" fermentation in minds & of trouble in the State?
   « The recall of the Magistrates of your Parlement [prétendue] of the
" misfortunes that one cannot envisage without dread; animated like
" them by the desire for your glory, always united in heart & in sentiment
" with the Officers into whose hands we have taken
" oath, attached by indissoluble bonds to the Body which we
" ministry alone represents today, & from which we could not
" separate ourselves without equally betraying our duty & our honor,
" we will not hesitate to beseech Your Majesty to be willing
" to make of talent that you promised us [font perdre] of the most
" profound grief, that the dispersal of the Members of your Parlement
" announces; & the too cruel circumstances the most ancient, cannot
" new & dangerous, that the intervention of the Laws of [fa]
" of a head, of public being of discipline, Monarchy of which one the
" prefer revolutions, & that in a monarchy of which one the
" alone of Masters, can make assure this liberty which always
" the soul of deliberations, & guarantee the safety of the real rights
" of the Sovereign & of those of his people.
   We will not speak of the necessity of a free verification
" If Your Majesty had wished to rise above these ancient
" & sacred forms, which partake of the Law, because they have
" been [fort] & simplicity, She could have imposed silence upon us by a
" simple act of her supreme power; but the public voice makes
" resound everywhere, in the silence which dependence imposes upon us, this
" pure & simple language of truth; & it is above all today without mixture
" of the Public Ministry that a King must recognize it...
