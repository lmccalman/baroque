The King has just appointed
Don Diego d'Navarro, Field Marshal,
and Governor of
Tarragona, as General Commander
of Havana, in Place
of the Marquis de la Torre, since
retired to Europe. This Mr. d'Navarro
is an excellent Officer, but
he is nearly 70 years old.

The News from Mexico
announces to us, that the
Earthquakes
which had previously
ruined Acapulco there, the Castle,
Warehouses, &c., and overturned
several Towns or Pueblos
are recurring entirely.

I have just been told, that the
Curate has received Notice of the happy
Arrival of our old Fleet
at Vera Cruz.
