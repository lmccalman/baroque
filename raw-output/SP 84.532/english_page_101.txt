Excellence at dear Mr. the Marquis of Langevin,
then Governor of that City, My brother
notably and all the rest of Geneva & Interpreted in
said S.r M Marquet. I believe that my father will have
a Commission at the Bureau of War, Which
is, perhaps, for us, more interesting than one
would imagine; by the facility to favor many things
in advance, & mark, with the good Stamp; but let us
always speak of this principle, Well paid, well Served. I
understand myself well.    Farewell
