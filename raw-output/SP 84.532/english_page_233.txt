    That Louis XII in 1506 forbade to his friends
& faithful the People holding the Courts of Parlement
in Paris, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Exchequers of Normandy & Dijon,... that they not undertake of good,
[treviennent], make, suffer, nor consent,
& oppose, nor contravene the Ordinances in
any manner whatsoever, on pain of being held
reputed disobedient & violators of the
Ordinances, but also, to annul & de-
clare null & of no effect & value all letters given
to the contrary.

    It is with the same intentions of reigning by
justice & reason that Charles VII in 1455 de-
clared & later Charles IX in 1561 that the subjects of the
Kingdom obey his letters, except that they
be civil, reasonable.

    It is according to these maxims that in 1576 the Estates
of Blois requested the Prince to maintain the in-
tegrity necessary of the authority of the Courts of Parle-
ment, complaining that violence was done to their re-
ligion & duty to comply & not to verify the
register of Edicts which should not be so, & add-
ing that the commandments, however urgent they may be,
are never [méfailliantes] when the Edicts are just
& good.

    They wished, Sire, to render your Parlement of
Paris criminal in the eyes of Your Majesty, for
having remained with Chambers assembled, & they have given to
this necessary step the name of cessation of
service. If the suspension of the course of private
affairs, to give all attention to public
affairs, were not justified by preference &
duties, we would find express order for it in the
edict of Henri II, who ordered in 1557 the Parle-
ment to attend to the affairs of the kingdom, all things
ceased.

    In the letter of Charles IX to the same Parlement
of 14 November 1561, to order it to attend

                                    7
                        all discontinuation of the office of simple justice &
                        exercise must be held as absolutely forbidden, it

                        In the letter addressed by Louis XIV to your
                        Parlement of Paris, for the registration of the
                        Declaration of 1673 which states, that the intention of the
                        King is that it be incessantly worked on; all
                        affairs ceasing until all the just &
                        [tel], the examples of [sagument] in this [foule] to the Law.

    The Estates General in 1356 & 1615, the Assem-
blies of 1614, those of Auvergne of 1314, of
Maine of 1358, of Languedoc & of Brittany have
so often had recourse to this effective form.

    It was at all times the usage of other Compa-
nies. The Grand Council followed it successfully in
1383, & the Chamber of Accounts had recourse to it
in the same year.

    It would be too long to report the multiplied
occasions where the Parlements also conformed to it. It
suffices to recall to Your Majesty, that in 1654,
the Parlement of Paris rendered Judgment to suspend
rendering justice to private individuals, until
justice had been done to those who had scorned the au-
thority of the King; it reiterated the same Judgment on 21 No-
vember following.

    Louis XIII in 1620, had declared by a Judgment
[révolté] all at once the [arengage] that this suspension
& the obligations imposed on the authority taken with the Kings,
the Seneschals, towards the Peoples.

    These cannot be the sentiments of a King upon
the wishes, but the force of an [importun-
tuneellement] serious necessity.
