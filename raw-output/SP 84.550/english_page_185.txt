Madrid the 15. April. 1776.

My Ministers near the Four
[Malter] for foreigners up to [Ca
tes defais].

My News from Malaga of the 3rd.
of the Current reports, that the Four
[Chaleks], under the Command of
Mr de Tejada, were ready to set
Sail at the first favorable Wind
to go on a Cruise, & protect
our Fishermen in Africa. And that
there was keenly felt the Death
of the famous Consul Mr Barcelo,
as brave as him, that it was a
true Loss for the Navy.

The freshest Advices from Ceuta
inform us, that all there is very
tranquil, that the King of Morocco
continues his Residences in His
Capital, while wanting to raise His Army
at Salala.                    Mex.
