for some time which had brought about this crisis. The King of Prussia upon what Marshal de Keith
had [?] written to him all that he had done of a happy nature since his arrival in France, congratulated
himself with him on the success of the operation and told him that the King of France is a very great King.
One awaits with impatience the continuation of this affair. We have had no occasion from Prussia
and one believes that at present the Prince of Prussia have not yet departed there to go see Mr. the Prince
of Brunswick. It is said that their departure is postponed until the end of next month. The King of
Prussia continues to be in Berlin where he lives very retired. He does not go to the Theater at all and
receives no one. Mr. Prince Frederick his brother goes often to Rheinsberg where he
makes many expenses. Mr. Prince Henry is always at [?] in Berlin. Mr. Prince
Ferdinand is going to go [?] as for the army one works on it always with the
greatest application, and the King of Prussia makes new regulations to render it
even better than it is. He has great maneuvers performed every year, and he
attends them himself to see if everything is done as he wishes. That is approximately
what I can inform you about this Court. There are indeed some small anecdotes that
I do not know well enough to instruct you about them.
