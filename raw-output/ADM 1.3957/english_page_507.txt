interesting about the Estates of Brittany.
Mr The Duke of Rouxembert is still in
Paris, the Parliament of the Crown, at Court,
where he has been well received, she hardly

of Lower Brittany and Poitou nevertheless
want to compel him to Pass.
        The Public has not yet arrived, and
the Duke is indisposed with the Flu.
        The Prince of Beauveau leaves around the
15 November to be of the French Academy
in the Place of Mrs de Moncris.

Quarrel with the estates of Beauvais over the
Weight of Posts and Prunes, or

nothing interesting.
