It is true that I had acquired in Marseille a small fortune, with which I could have been content, but I sought to increase it, and the means that I employed to succeed in this had been so fortunate, that I counted on being able in a short time to make my wealth productive in other countries. I undertook different commercial enterprises which succeeded very well for me. I had made acquaintance with Sr Balma, Merchant of Genoa who has his correspondent in Marseille. He proposed to me that we together outfit a vessel for the Scales of the Levant, and for the coasts of Barbary. I willingly consented to this proposition, and we agreed to depart immediately. The Vessel was equipped in a short time. We departed from Marseille in the month of April 1746. We sailed first toward the coasts of Barbary, where we disembarked different merchandise, and where we received others in return. From there we passed to the Scales of the Levant, where we conducted the same commerce with the same success. We returned to Marseille in the month of September of the same year. This enterprise succeeded perfectly well for us. We then made a second voyage, which was no less advantageous to us. After which we separated, and I made alone a third voyage, which procured for me the same advantages.

I found myself after these three voyages very content with my small fortune. I resolved to retire, and to enjoy in peace the fruit of my labors. But Providence had ordained otherwise. Here is what happened to me.
