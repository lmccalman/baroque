Paris, January 5, 1773.

The fall of our
two Ministers has caused all the more
the greatest Sensation.
All the Ministers and all those who
had Positions, have been confirmed
by the Duke of la Vrilliere and the Count du
Muy, but [on le medecin sien, vienne
Musy], and soon [entres ton] will be
in this Post as usual.
One is very prevented from approving what
we have for Minister,
and M. de Maupeou keeps his the
Position.
One has just made a table
of all the Officers of this Department,
it appears that one would like to staff
all our Verifiers and Brigadiers,
both here and at l'Orient, these
are lacking 227, even supposing
that they were all in State and that
at Sea, there are many to whom
one has given forced Retirements,
who are too old to be
employed in chief, and at Sea, but there are few
Cadets, which is very bad for
the Subdelegates.
