M.d Estaing is made a Grande of Spain,
according to the Letters from Madrid, and it
is said at the same Time, that the King of Spain
has named Don Antonio Ulloa, to
succeed M.r Galvez as Minister
of the Spanish Navy.

Last Tuesday M.r Franklin
presented to the King the medal that the
Commissioners of the United States had
struck here, on the occasion of the Independence
of America.

The Loan of 24. Million was
settled in the Council last Saturday.
It would have been filled, if one had wanted
to receive in full the Submissions of
Notaries, Bankers &c. but one has
given the Third to the Public, of the parish,
and to profit from the Advantages that this
Loan presents, without it being obliged
to buy the Notes of the Second Hand.
It has been evaluated that this Loan costs the
King, a little more than 5 and a Quarter,
per Cent.
