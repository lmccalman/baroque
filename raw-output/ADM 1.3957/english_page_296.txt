If this Earthquake had occurred
three hours later, no one would have been saved,
the weather was fine, and the greater
Part of the Citizens were at the Promenade.

It is said that the Mountain of Tapiom has
considerably subsided, and that a Volcano
has risen from it with stinking Fountains.
This is not confirmed.

The Sea at the Departure of the Courier was at 5
Feet above its ordinary Level;
from which one concludes that the Earth has subsided.

There is very little harm at [Il Meurt]. The Plague is
also passing. The Part of Port Dauphins
even less so.

There you have roughly all that is known
up to the present.

The River of Col de Sac has been lost.
No traces of it remain any longer.
