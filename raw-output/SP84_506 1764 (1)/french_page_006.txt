Rotterdam may 1st 1764.

My Lord

It is my fear for the well prosperity of
his majesty's new dominions in north
america that prompts me to send for your
lordship's perusal the inclosed copy of a paper
which I have believed had it seen after the
signing of the Preliminaries of Peace.
Altho' the time of the greatest harvest, in
the reduction of Germains troops is now past,

this

R.H. Earl of Sandwich.
