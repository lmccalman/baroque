Countrymen my Age which placed me near
sought months. The Circumstances,
which I had begun me still able
to carry on with us all the usual and dignity
in the Dilection and execution of those
Affairs which I have the honour to be
entrusted with - consistent with the Rules
your Dutcheness for with the Orders
of the Lord High Lord Sandwich,
I hope we to have the wished for Effect;
as to the manners or means of doing it,
I leave entirely to the Judgment of
my Friends, and I trust that from afar
avoid the Eyes of what they shall judge
proper to do for me.

I have the honour to be.

                    Your most humble and
                    most Obedient Servant
