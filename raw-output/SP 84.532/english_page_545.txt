Pondicherry the 25th September 1770.

     The Triton brought us
the Decline of the Company, and following
the Consternation in the Colonies, they are making
a considerable Reform in the
Employees of the Company, which affects
no one's rights, but unfortunately
for Mather, and integrity is lacking.
We only needed War
to finish us off.
     Work continues to fortify
this Town, according to the Plan that was formed
2 Years ago.
     Mr. Dupré Dutch Governor
is in dispute with the Committee and the
Outfitters of the English Ships,
concerning the Capture of a Vessel
which they prevented them from having inspected
upon [l'abordanty] their people forbade
taking Wood to make our
Barks, and much is needed for
the fortifications. They are going to call upon
[le Maire], to go fetch some at the Bay
of Tranquebar. All this does us
great harm, and causes great Delay for
our fortifications.

                                       From
