Private Letters

                                                Paris, April 22, 1783.

                                                                        I arrived through the
Private details that were recounted about
the Chancellor's last Operation,
that he combined the figure, the Minister
of War, all the Councilors of State,
to the Intendants and General Commissioners,
and, finally, even the chance. Of all the
men of the Grand Council, there were
only g. who were too informed about
what was happening in the affair of Barberies,
he excluded them, and returned as far as into
the King's Cabinet to their Majesties at
the Chancellor's and [Melles] of the Letters Patent,
and they were about thirty, charging
them with having or interesting
their Colleagues, except the Chancellor
showed himself to the Company, and thus
that he should meet it at the Council of State
and dispatches, but that he made them with
[Me de Bougre] to hold them from another.
That was always that someone the [Receptis]
of states, and to resign it to the Will
of the King, without risking their goods.
