                    Paris, December 5, 1790.

                    Messieurs of Toulon
        of the 20th tell us about the Orderings
        of the Batteries, and still no Workers
        for armies.

        One had expected for a long time
some events in the
Ministry, the Clergy being on the
Eve of separating from our govern-
ment.

        Monday the King convoked the peers [présenter]
for the Chapel Duke de la Vrillière
went to the Duke de Chevreuse's, and to him
signify the King's order to surrender
the seals Departments, and the
Superintendence of the Posts, and to
retire to his lands at Chantelong.

        The Lord Keeper of the Seals [d'est Brongé] but
the instructions of the Duke de la Vrillière
presented with [Donnés Defficaces] to the
Duke de Chevreuse to not write
to Chantelong other than Families,
Without manifesting to the prejudice of the
King and to surveil in the Kingdom
the Doors of his Correspondents.
