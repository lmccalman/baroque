Brussels, February 5, 1770:

There is talk of Count
Stüremberg to succeed
Count Cobentzel, others claim
that it will be Monsieur de Mercy, who
is well regarded at Court, and who has always
worked with the Deceased.

Fifty Artillerymen
left yesterday for Ostend, and they
will be followed next week
by Eighty Laborers.
