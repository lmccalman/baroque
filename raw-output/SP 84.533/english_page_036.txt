all the Members of this Court received orders
in the evening to be present the next day
at the Chamber to await the Orders
of the King. That same evening Mr. the Count
of St Florentin accompanied by the Marshal des
Refulieux, and two Counselors of State,
brought the inventory to this Chamber,
which found itself after dinner assembled with
few people. There was made a reading of the
King, and the Court having complied with it without
other Deliberations, which had not been
agitated beforehand, of this Number are the
Patents for the Appanage of the Count
of Provence, the edict of the union of the Parliament
and the Superior Councils, another
concerning the Judges of the Officers of these
Councils and of the Parliament.

Before the Registration Mr. Nouvel,
Attorney General of this Court, made a
Speech of the greatest force against
the violence exercised, he made [d'abiles
Notes] who had protested, then all at once
agreeing to the Principal; for said he
in Paris, the edict is registered, there
remained nothing more than to register at this
Audience an infinite crowd, which applauded
thunderously at this Speech.
