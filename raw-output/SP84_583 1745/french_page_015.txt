Sir and thus British Dragoons and their Horses
and arrived safe in Flushing void Cambridge
one ship was since coming over & Ostand with the
and thirty horses on board, the people were all
saved; I am now returning to Flushing with
the empty transports, from thence to load them in
Ostand Road, and I am very desirous for hours
to desire his excusing my falling attendance on
this Service. -

I do not hear any thing particular from Ostand, the
Defence is as brave as the attack is desperate. I am
affraid the finale will make a push to morrow
being St Louis Day.

I have the honor to be
                                        Sir
                                        Your most humble
Lille August 23d 1740 N.S.              & most obedient Servant
                                        R. Worms.
