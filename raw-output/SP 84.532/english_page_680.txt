Madrid, June 6, 1773.

                    The Letters due
up to make mention only of the
continuation of the Disarmament
of the Warships and Frigates
in the different Ports.

I am written from Cadiz, that Four
Warships of the Department
of Cartagena, have received Orders to
conduct to Barcelona a Battalion
of Spanish troops, and another
of Walloons, and to transport
at the same time to Cartagena, where they
must be disarmed, a Part
of Construction Wood.

The Reports from Cartagena indicate,
that there was launched into the Water on the 20th of last month,
a Vessel of 70 Pieces of Canon,
named the Francis Xavier, and a
Brigantine of 36 Canons, named
the St. Theresa.
