Private Letter

Paris, October 30, 1775.

By the registration of the
Edicts one purchased, several Months ago:
20 Thousand Livres for full-length Portraits of
Charles V. King of England, by
Vandyck. The Academy has its place in
his Apartment next to that
of the King, and it appears that this is not
without design; it is assured that every
time His Majesty returns
to his County of [Bords naturelles]
seems tired of Anger, and is
turned toward Clemency, He
represents to Him the example of the unfortunate
Monarch. He makes Him understand
that among Parliaments sovereigns
are carried to an Attack
of this Kind, & the Chancellor had not
made Him glimpse their
criminal Plots. However absurd the
Supposition may be, it contains
the Prince for the Moment, and it is
from the Foot of this Painting that depart the
Touches
