Rotterdam, 26 January 1779.

Sir
     The Vienna Correspondent writes,
that there is, in London, the Remainder
of the Bible of the Camisards, is occasioned
by cramps in his Arms; but that our
Author is going to work again to finish that
Book, and send it immediately to
Vienna; But if he had a friendly opinion returned
from that Place, he would finish it as he likes
it best, and only he thinks he has
no time when he could converse with the
Secretary of his Correspondence.
     Part of the Military Regulations
he has sent off, and the other Part
will follow the first Opportunity.
     But the first Part which he
has sent, is not come to hand yet;
which is sent by the ordinary Post -
Pray can it be so slow?
     I trust the Answer will be with due Respect

Sir
your most humble &
Most Obedient Servant
L.C. Plesse.
