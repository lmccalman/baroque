[Main text:]
I wrote to you on the 9th of January last, in response to your letter of the 4th of November, and informed you that I was receiving at that time the one of the 21st of October in which you announced to me that you were in correspondence with Mr Dubois our common friend, so that he would send you directly the things which I might need, and with which he would be charged for me.

[Upper text block:]
I am persuaded that this letter will have reached you, but as I have not yet received any response to it, I take advantage of the occasion which presents itself to reiterate my very humble respects to you, and to show you how sensitive I am to all your kindnesses. I hope that you will be willing to continue to preserve them for me, and that you do not doubt the sincerity of my attachment and my gratitude.
