L'Orient, March 31, 1783

An English frigate which came
[tonné] on the 14th to the Company of the Indies in Paris
has found again for four days three Vessels
from this Port.

The Junge, for Bengal, last year,
with wheat, departed this Morning. It takes back
the entire Council of Pondicherry and the Délité.

The Dauphine which goes to the Isle of Coromandel
[parfont] for the Isles, will depart Tomorrow,
They [sontres] out eight to fifteen days.

It is inconceivable to see the
quantity of Passengers of all kinds who
board our four last Chiefs Young
the [enrrettiens] to the Isles and to the Indies children
our Vessels are going to be strewn as
are the Water Coaches, with an extraordinary
assembly of People seeking good fortune
who are going to starve our unfortunate
Colonies, seeking gold [perdse].
and who will be of little use there.
