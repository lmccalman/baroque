Table de Marbre, have been confirmed.
The Roll of Buildings
for the King is estimated at 4. to 5. Millions,
without including the Roll of Private individuals,
who saved nothing of their
Merchandise, the fire having started
at night, and the Merchants being
peacefully at their homes in
the City.

The Religious of all Churches
worked continuously
at this fire, with an indefatigable zeal,
and have well merited the praises
that are generally given them;
They are there today, only
by the tardy abundance of Effects
that are found Gradually in
the Ashes; which is an Object
of pure Confidence. There were
many of these Religious who
nearly perished, but there were
only two Capuchins wounded.
