old wood, could not hold
the Sea as long as those of
new Wood, His Majesty having declined
to take them, but Mr. Gallera has made
proof by the Constructors that these
Vessels were as solid as those
of new Wood, and has given a Security
of 22 Thousand Louis, that these Vessels
would hold the Sea for 25
Years. This Security has been accepted,
and the King will pay him Ecus per Hundred
during the 25 Years. There was much
about this affair; if one
sees that Mr. Gallera must have
found the Secret of strengthening the
wood, and protecting it from Worms. Adieu
voir.
