N.° 55

Paris the 26th April 1773.

Nothing faithful to us,
one would only hear there what Rousseau surrounded it with,
from which one hopes that he will learn the [étourderrie]
that Mr. Moseley had put, that he has
[maniman] the own that [abscisse].

Le Gros Retz has some money at Toulon,
and thus, V. Amiot at Nevers, one
Morning, for an excellent Song. It
continues, the work of Thomas one
soon at his place.

The King who was to come last Monday
to Choisy, had to return yesterday evening to
Versailles.

Nothing very interesting has happened
this week. The Chancellor was
heard for his Accounts, one does not know,
he had another Meetings and the Networks
but that goes better. He returns this
evening to Paris.

The Affair of the Premiums is not yet
finished. There are three Days and Paris to receive
a Payment, one hopes that the Premiums
work on it. These are the Days of
Wind and of Montrouge.

[Chacque oblongue], the King must come
one time or another or Two.
