The King gave Audience Sunday
to the Deputies of the Parliament of Dijon.
His Majesty received them very coldly,

known to you in my Presence."

In Consequence of which their Decree
was annulled by the Decree of the Council
was struck out and erased from their Registers.

[Le Revest] having read, the King said:

"Do not stray further from the Respect that is
due to me, and confine yourselves within the Principles
that I recalled to you in my Response
of March 2, 1768, and from which I shall never
depart. I make
known to you my Intentions regarding your
Disquiet and on the Subject of the same
Grand Councils."
