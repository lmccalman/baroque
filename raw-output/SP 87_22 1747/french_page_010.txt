My Lord,
            I have received the two letters
of the 28th past & 5th Inst. If Your
Lordship has been pleased to honour
me with, You make large returns
on such triffles as my Albert, but
I desire you would understand I
have not the least purpose of lay-
ing away upon your Lordships fa-
vour, it was always purposed that
whatever allowance his Majty should
think fit to make Mr Walters should
be paid out of the Contingent Force
Money, but He wanted some sort of
guide as to the quantum.

The Earl of Chesterfield.
