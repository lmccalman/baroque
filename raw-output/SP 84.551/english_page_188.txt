          Although there no longer appears
to be any question of Armament, they continue
the Rolls of [bts.], and they are having delivered the [Bourru-
ques] pounds of Biscuit, and 2 Thousand Barrels,
recently made for the Armament of a
Squadron of 15 or 18 Vessels.
     The Minister accepts the Proposition
that was made to him, to conform to the
Rules and Regulations, for the Distribution
of the brigade of [Ouvrage gens].
     And as for the [Ablette] the Vigilante,
she was to carry only 186 Cannons
of Six pounds.
     They are expecting Two frigates from the Levant;
that of M. de Chabert must rejoin
in France, our Ambassador who
is in Constantinople.
