Paris, April 12, 1776

Our Letters from Brest
of the 3rd and the 7th, say that Mr. Achard
the Squadron and the one and the other barely at
The [Cavaliers] of the Roadstead. One
[Convelles] appointed to the Post
many letters. That the 2nd this
squadrons [apeut] [Roudes] toward the Cape
Minister, to conduct the
Division from Toulon, and that such this
Division must separate, to
return to Provence. The Officers
of the Squadron appear to me [fortifiens]
content with the evolutions that one
had done by Mr. Du Chaffault, not
[de moins en fruit lui]. Which makes
believe that the evolutions were not
the principal object of this
Armament, but that the
Circumstances have changed.
Sartine P.t de Bretigny will write there
Conformably the Marshal de Brons the
Vauguyon and Duquesne.
