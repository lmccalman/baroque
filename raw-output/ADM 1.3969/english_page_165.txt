N. 28 July

Genoa the 3rd July 1783.

Several of our Merchants are trying to build
Vessels of 18 to 20 Cannons, to sell them
to Spain, which will employ them against the
Algerians, who are strong in our Vicinity.
A few days ago, they captured in
our Waters a Polacca of Seven Men Crew,
loaded with Wheat.

At Varallo, they are building, for account of
Private parties, Five Brigantines of Capacity of 500 Tons,
and in different other Ports, Vessels
smaller, which will be employed in
Commerce.

It is assured today, that Peace is being negotiated
between the [Brey] of Spain, and the Dey of Algiers;
that our Republic and the States of Italy
will be included in this Peace. In the meantime,
Spain maintains a good Squadron quite ready.

Our Advices from Corsica say, that all there is very
tranquil.
