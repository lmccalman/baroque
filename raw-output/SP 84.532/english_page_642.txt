They recalled in support of this
Conjecture, that the King's brother, some
Years ago, led him secretly
from Avignon to Poland in this dette
Brussels, where he was made Pope, for the
greatest Lords; they even claim
that this Prince had taken
obligations for one of the first
Princesses of Poland, but that out of
Delicacy he [abuza co n'était manqué]
refused the Marriage, saying that he
would never offer any Princess
to his Adversary, but that fortune
coming to change, he hoped to be
still young enough not to
leave the States without Posterity.
Finally, one of these Politicians (who
nevertheless appeal at Court and with
the Ministers, who bear nothing
of what they have, and draw from them
Consequences even to push until they
have proposed the Secrets of State and of the
said, is in this only a [fee] to make
understood a certain Minister (have you named him?)
