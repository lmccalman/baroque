No 2. Febry. No. 2.

Paris the 22nd January 1776.

Mr Turgot is still
at Versailles, he has not come to Paris
for three weeks, not Artists,
who seemed to owe much
to the Court, it was even believed that they
were going to be named; I have been there
to thank, and I gain from it today
One hundred percent; he who loses nothing
from it is honestly not too badly
done; I would still have much

The continuation of the operations of
Mr de St Germain begins to
appear: It is the Military that is
definitively suppressed, the Students
[biontrepides], and [délève], before
five Colleges, belonging to the
Benedictines, for 700 Livres
de Boston, per Year, for each one.
