Nivernois who is accredited to Your Majesty
the Baron of Breteuil was to go to Vienna,
and the Count of Usson to Stockholm; the Duke

Ambassadors named for these Courts

Offices contain, as the Partisans
call it.

in Quarrels of Reigns. One has placed from
my side at the Grand Chamber, so much
there is exposed very tranquilly.
