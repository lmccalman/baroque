N°. 10.

                                        Brest, January 23, 1775.

                    The Revolution in the
Ministers has infallibly either diminished or
delayed business, and that is why we
have today made 8 days in three Months.
However, much is expected in the
coming week.
    One may have embarked on the Robuste 450
assembled in 15 [Tours] in need.
    There are 4 [Etat] where all the sails are
complete, and the other works of sailmakers [à bien en
matière] 80 or at least, and 15 frigates
in the [Carcenal] next Month.
    The [baguets] of the last two [Bâtillarens]
departed, were with the 4 days [le Regne], the
North winds will determine them, I believe the
last of this Month.
    There are 18 Boats in the [Vaisée].
    It is the B. that Villevien put [à la Draille].
    How do we not send all this with
News that gives us from Cayenne
Peace as certain; we have
every reason to believe it, but one wants to be
prepared in the different actions.
    We will begin at La Hogue a frigate
[de l'espérance de feu], carrying from 25 to 500
Tons of Port, fitted out by the King,
and destined to transport Salts,
Munitions and Troops...
