Letter from the Chevalier de Soupire

Pondichery this 18th March 1755.

If the impossibility of undertaking anything
has obliged me to employ my time in gathering
the Troops and in making the Preparations for the Campaign,
the Shortage of Provisions makes them go very slowly, and
we hold ourselves in hope of our Reinforcements.

M. de Bussy has been obliged to deplete himself
to appease the Troubles that have arisen in his
Canara. Pigonnaly, his Brother, has seized all
the Artillery and seems to have a Design to dethrone him,
He has marched against him, and has been obliged in sending the Chief
of the Marottes, M. le Baron, has named himself Media-
tor to reconcile these belligerent Powers, and
to draw from it the Advantage that will be most advantageous to us.
His Journey also has for purpose to treat with Ragirao
in order to prevent the Troubles that he was beginning to excite
really in his State, and have forced the Soudeur to send
in demands. He has already obtained
the Evacuation of our Provinces of Carnatic that the
Troops were beginning to ravage, they have
despoiled there a Counsellor and two French Officers
with some Cypayes and People of their retinue
who were returning to Pondichery. Demands have been made, their
Ambassador is charged with it and must give incessantly their
Responses, with charge on their part to restore

M. de Bussy and M. de Moracin Commanding
of Masulipatnam, ask me both
300 or 400 Men, they would apparently be
very necessary to them, but I cannot satisfy them, and
exhort them
