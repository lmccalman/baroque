At Cadiz they were expecting from
Ferrol, 10 Warships,
and 4 Frigates; without speaking of
the true destination.
     The day after tomorrow must depart
from here, the Two Battalions of
Guards, who have been in Service
to the King for two Years;
for Barcelona; and the same
Day they will be replaced by
Two other Battalions, who
are in the Vicinity.
