Rennes, April 28, 1789.

                    Affairs are
always in the same State, Hopes
are strengthening from good to good, but no
determined Objects, nothing that announces
a Development, nor the Manners
in which it will be done.
     Our Prince President Mr d'Ormeilly
has gone to the Court, where he is summoned; they
offer him a Position of Counselor of State,
at 80 Thousand Livres of Pension, to
resign; he refuses.
     Our Duke whom [le deplait] here, and
would like to change his Benefice for
another. The Parliament will [furit]
nothing, or almost nothing. Our
Intendant attracts the Esteem and
Friendship of everyone.
