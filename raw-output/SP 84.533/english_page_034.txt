A Deputation from the
parliament went to Versailles last Sunday
to bring Remonstrances to the King, on the Edict
that removes the Counselors since 1715,
and abolishes the Councils that were held in
the small Royal Courts. [Il'en les Claygères]
who would not register it, the King received very badly
this Deputation, He responded that he
would have the Remonstrances examined, And that he
would send them His Response. There is talk at
the same time great horror of the [Pitraites] and
the Remonstrances, nothing transpires to the
outside, according to the King's Intentions.
There was last Sunday a Council
of Ministers at Marshal de Noailles's house,
it was resolved there, that the Military Deputies
should have Begun to Reform by themselves.
[Suivis aupres] of Monsieur to reform
and the regulars. The Regiment or the
Corps of [Batruétiers] of Common Louis [se ce]

Colonel Commander of it.
