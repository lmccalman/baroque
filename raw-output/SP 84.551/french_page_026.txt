Rotterdam the 5th July 1776

Sir,

Receiving no Answer from
you to my last of concerning the Star,
I had the honor to write to you about,
I concluded, that perhaps for Want
of an Opportunity, to make a tryal
of it, it was not worth had, at least
for the present time; and as I had
to give an Answer to the Person
who applied to me upon that occasion,
I wrote him, that no Order was had
in the Virtue of this Star, and that if the
world, for the Proof the honour
of it would not be felt after so far as much
of it, gratis, as to make the Experiment.
I did not expect an Answer to it;
but I have received a Letter, in
which he acquaintes me, that he
has sent me of said embalmed Birds.
(By which I have not heard of yet)
