Rotterdam 26th January 1773.

My Lord

The Letters of the 22d Instant, which brought me the Honour of your Lordship's Letter of the 14th Instant together with my two Letters were delayed with Numbers who had those to deliver, in hopes that by the Windt's being contrary, it might overtake the Packet Boat.

Since we were to lose the Castle of Spain at the Council of State of the Admiralty Department, It is a great Happiness to me to see, that the King has made choice of your Lordship to replace him. As I have already had so many Marks of your Lordship's Approbation of my Services, I have great Reason to hope that the same will continue under his Excellency, and, I flatter myself, the Continuation of your Lordship's Protection.

I have also the Honour to congratulate your Lordship upon the Declaration Signed by the Prince of Hessframe in the Name of the King his Master to the Satisfaction of His Majesty.

This

Right Earl of Halifax.
