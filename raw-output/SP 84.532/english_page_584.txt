what had been the effect of the Embarkations
in the Country of Liège, in the frontiers
and in several other Cities and Germany,
in the Rhine.

I am assured that there are a great many
French officers of different ranks,
who are expatriating themselves to go serve in
Russia.

The German and Russian armies of the
north and of the Levant, of which I had the honor
are such that their movements reveal it
to our Ministers, but nothing transpires
from their Dispatches.

I know of the sending of an extraordinary
[courrier] from the Court of Madrid;
the next day another was sent back
from Versailles to Madrid; one claims
that something new is happening
and interesting, even pressing
between these two Courts, but time
can only sort it out in due course.

That is all that I can inform you of;
the events are so weighty, and it is
time that must bring them to us.
