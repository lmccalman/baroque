Madrid the 31 June 1776

The rumor was circulating here,
that the King of Portugal had relapsed, and
had reached the Extreme; and that
a Civil War was feared,
because of the division of Minds,
and the different Parties that had
formed for the Kingdom,
the Bulk of the
Troops had been withdrawn to the Center of the Kingdoms;
however this merits Confirmation.

Our frontiers, as much in Old
Castile, as in Estremadura,
swarm so much with troops
at present, that one no longer knows
where to put them in Quarters; and
despite all these Movements of
War, it is believed that there will be nothing,
and that all is settled by
Mediation
