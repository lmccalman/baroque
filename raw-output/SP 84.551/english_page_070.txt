Response of the Council: Since I had
also here, appeared to us very
equivocal, and in no way
justified by the acts. Chiefs;
will not come out of there. I add
to it another Dialogue,
analogous to the affair, which
may be kept like
the et cetera and the collection of my
Representations, that one
proposes to make shortly,
and which marks after the Spirit
of the Citizens and Bourgeois;
this affair could have
Consequences, as would it
indicate the Motto of the Dialogue
Pelotons, &c.
