Rotterdam Janry t. 1771.
Mr Wickens

R.B.

Bruale.

I have received yours of the 28 December 
last with the Bill of Lading of the 
Cargo of the Eagle Capt. Jackson
Coming from Smyrna [un foin de
du Goût Courant] and as it must
have been Delayed at Rotterdam
I flatter myself that it will not delay
arriving here after which I will give
you notice how I will have
disposed of it.

I am with Esteem

Sir

Your very humble Servant

M. Dedein
