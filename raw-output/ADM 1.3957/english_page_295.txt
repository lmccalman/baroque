From Cap, June 11, 1770.

The Couriers arrived yesterday
Evening, report that the City of Port-au-
Prince, and that of Léoganne, have been entirely
destroyed by the Earthquake;
there remains not a single House; the great
Church, the palace of the King, the Hospital, the Church,
the Buildings of the Jesuits, the beautiful Church of the
Nuns of St. Jean Ronce, have
had the same Fate; there are no [Symptome],
[pour rendre les Mains qu'reçoivent] this
Event.

[L'apprendre de Ramolle qu'on la lancé] that
[deux Monnayes], The Church of the Port, that of
St. Marc, and the Church of [Dame]. The
Earthquake recommenced with
as much Violence, the 12th or 20th December.
To give you an Idea of this
Violence, it suffices to tell you, that the
Persons who found themselves in the
public squares were knocked down.

The Courier's Departure [en courge] counts in
the City of Port-au-Prince 500 and some
dead Persons and double the Wounded.

All the Effects have been buried under the
Ruins of the Buildings, fortunately
there was no Fire.
