Toulon, November 25, 1781.

There is an order from the Court
to arm with diligence the brigades, the
Sultane, and the Mignonville, under the
command of a Chevalier
d'Oppede, and of Mr de la Croix de
Guigues. Many things are lacking
for these Objects, the Provisions
ordered have not arrived, but
that holds back nothing. These two
brigades must go [demers]
of Archipelago to relieve the two oldest
ones that are cruising there, [il y qui
arriveront rouler].

Our Letters from Brest of the 20th say,
that this Port has furnished [rendement de salt],
and is not susceptible to the
[Nouvementès]. The [vingt est], that the
news that we [receroint] from it
are not to our [flour].
