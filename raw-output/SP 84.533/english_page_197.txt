Madrid the 9th September 1773.

I have just received
news from Cadix, that the Warship
the Dragon, arrived there in
39 Days of Navigation from the Canary
Islands, having brought back the Remainder
of the Regiment of America, which was
to garrison in the said
City.
The Warship the Atlante
has also returned there from its Cruise
in the Mediterranean:
They continue to write to me from Ferrol,
and from Carthagena, that nothing
is happening there that merits the slightest
Attention.
