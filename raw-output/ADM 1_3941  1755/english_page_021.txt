in Paris the 11th August 1785.

We are still here Without
Declaration of War, although all
the Measures that one takes, tend towards it;
The Ordinance for the augmentation of
Troops appears; Orders are sent to the Ports
iterative orders to accelerate the
Equipments; The Couriers from Berlin
are frequent; one arrived from
Madrid last Tuesday which occasioned
an extraordinary Council.

The Public flatters itself greatly on
the Cooperation of Spain, but one
doubts.

Besides the Savings of the King one speaks
for new Means of finance, of establishing
new Farmers-General.

I Am inclined to believe that one of the
Motives which delays the Declaration, is to
give Time for the Vessels of the Great
and Small Indies to return.
