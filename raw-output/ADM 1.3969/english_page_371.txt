Since the departure of
My [Austronave] for Constantinople,
they have published here with the customary
formalities, free trade with the Turks
both by sea and by land; they await
a Turkish Consul in Cartagena.

According to the latest Letters from
Mallorca and from Cartagena, it appears
that the expedition against Algiers was
completely ready. They will undertake to attack
the Port of Algiers, after having destroyed
the City and the Shipyards. There are four
to five Knights of Malta, and an
English officer, who are going to depart
for Cartagena, to go for
in this expedition, so it is
said.

They speak of a general levy
throughout the Kingdom of [Lèvre]
