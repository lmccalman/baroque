Monsieur The Duke N.G. 1737

Monsieur, If moments are always precious to
the Crown, it is necessary that these be even more so
the Royal affairs, the presences where She is of the most important for the public good
of the State which are the last which are lacking to her of this
Campaign; it is necessary that the general armament projected in this Kingdom
to form her army. Now as in the country of
Languedoc we know of the greatest number of those who range themselves
under the protection of His Majesty, and that the honor of
commanding them imposes upon us the agreeable obligation to make them
advance at convenient times according to the exigency of orders, and in the
dispositions in which we have placed ourselves to receive them
which will be in disposition to march when it shall be judged
appropriate, in expectation I am with a very profound respect of the honor
to render account to Your Grandeur of all that which
may arrive of considerable with a very profound respect and by this
Letter to remain Monseigneur

Paris 8ber 1704
