Don Michael Gurton, Chief of Squadron,
after having resupplied the [flenne],
had to depart the day before yesterday,
to proceed to the [Colisiere]
along the Coasts of Portugal,
he must finish the Embarkation of a
[baye], if it appears that one had
time, that one was preparing a Reinforcement
of 3 to 4 Thousand Men, for
America.

This [nons] offering, and whatever
might be, one has flattered oneself, that if there are
[bages], it will be for one, or the one
America, and that one will hold here
simply on the Defensive,
in order not to embroil ourselves
with France, and England,
and avoid a general War.
