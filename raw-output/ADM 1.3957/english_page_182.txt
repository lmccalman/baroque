                                    Paris the 7th May 1770.

                                                    The Chevalier de

Rohan returned from St Domingue in the
frigate la Blonde, having been sent back by
M. the Prince with the prohibition to return to St Domingue,
this Prince is in Paris, and has been to the Court, where
he was well received; which confounds all the
enemies.

        M. de la Vigne Buisson, Captain of the
Vessels of the East India Company, is
named to command the Maxime at
Lorient, in concert with Mr Charpentier
Commissary Ordonnateur; Mr des
Aspy Intendant, will reside at the
Portuguese apartments of the Ports.

        This City is reduced forever, for
a Month more than 5000 Persons have left it.

        The Vessels the Pantheon, and les
Bourbons departed, the latter was
loaded at the Isle of Aix, no other is
departing from it, thus Commerce will be
quite languishing.

        The [Indiens] of the East India Company
have been returned to the Company, and the latter has
given the title of [Commis forces du Roy].
to work on the Liquidation.
