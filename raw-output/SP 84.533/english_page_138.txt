Madrid the 12th August 1773.

By the last Courier
from Cartagena I have just received Notice,
that the Frigate [avoitellement] constructed,
and that one destined for The Philippine
Islands, as I announced to you
in my last, had been sold [aux
portés] for La Vera.

They write to me from Cadix, that The naval
Vessels returned from La Havana, reported,
that there had been [donne à Rieu] two Brigantines
of [Ster] 12th January, The Raphael of 60, and
The St Pedro de Alcantara of 60. Cannons.

That The Warship The Castille is
in state [parles] 3rd May, to [de vendre]
to La Vera Crux.

That The new War Frigate, The
Santa Laura, was on the 30th May at La
Vera Crux, and that as soon as one would have
learned that The English [avoient fait] Spain
and England had been signed,
it was to depart from there to return
to Europe.
