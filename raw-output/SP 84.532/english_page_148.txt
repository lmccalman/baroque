we have seen oppose our will a resistance contrary to our
rights, & to deliver the most characterized infraction to our Lit.
We have uselessly exhausted, to bring them back to their duties,
all means of gentleness & authority, & their disobedience
has finally forced us, despite ourselves, to punish excesses that our
intention had been to prevent. But while we await having
chosen a sufficient number of Officers capable of composing
our Parlement, we must provide for the administration of
justice; & we believe we cannot better fulfill this object than by
employing for this purpose all the Officers of our Council, whose
zeal & attachment to our Person we know well enough,
to be persuaded that they will know how to reconcile the new functions
that we find ourselves obliged to entrust to them at this moment,
with those which they fulfill so worthily near our Person.
FOR THESE CAUSES & others moving us thereto, We have,
by the advice of our Council, & of our certain knowledge, full
power & royal authority, commissioned & do commission all the
Officers of our Council to hold our Court of Parlement, in the
places & in the accustomed manner, & there to fulfill & exercise all
the functions of our said Court, both in Civil as in Criminal matters, without
any exception or limitation, & just as our said Officers
were authorized to fulfill & exercise them, all following the distribu-
tion set forth by the said attachments under the counter-seal of the present;
giving power to the said persons of our Council, to render
together justice in body of sovereign Court, in our name, fol-
lowing & conforming to the establishment of our said Court, & until
it has been by us otherwise ordered: We will that our
Advocates & Attorneys General continue their functions there:
As also we enjoin all Clerks, Attorneys, Ushers
& other inferior Officers of our said Court, to recognize
the said Officers of our Council in the said quality, to obey them
& all, as holding our said Court, all under such penalty as shall
be appropriate, even under penalty of disobedience. WE THEREFORE GIVE IN
COMMAND to our beloved & faithful the People holding, by virtue of
our present letters, our said Court of Parlement of Paris, that they
shall register them, & the content therein keep, observe
& execute according to their form & tenor: FOR SUCH IS OUR
PLEASURE. Given at Versailles, the twenty-third day of January,
