My Lord Duke,

one Martial a Citizen of Amsterdam
famous for the Shire, which he had in the
Assemblies of the Dueling and particularly
for having heard the Carpenters of the
Domicily and last made goods (known
by the name of Bychas) and having mixed
them in favour of the Duke of Orange,
whom his Highness came to Amsterdam
to change the Magistrates, was arrested
last week and his Papers Seized, he is sent
a prisoner to the Hague which is so much
against the Priviledges of the Citizens of
Amsterdam, that it is thought that he must
be guilty of some very dangerous intrigues
