Letter from the Citizens of a Parlement stating
that it will be installed in the upper part of the Palace
by the Chancellor, which has been carried out.
This Magistrate went to the Louvre with
the Ministers and the Grand Council, they go down
to the residence of the First President, where several
Members of this Parisian Parlement
met them, the Chancellor led them
into the Grand Chamber, to perform
the installation and the Distribution of
Chambers, and were carried to Rouen,
to [déspatrons] there. The installation
at the Palace was done very peacefully,
although there was an infinite crowd.

We soon expect the Chambers of the
Parlement of Paris (these must be the
Parties) in the frontier Provinces.

This Parlement was to go this
evening to St Denis, but the Council decided
that many of the named Members
do not go there, and have already submitted their
Resignations, as well as Messieurs de la
de Fleury Attorney General, and Seguier
Advocate General. Mr le Luc finds himself
in Rouen, replaces the late Belin as Attorney
General. Mr Butteau de Champy
replaces Montalet presiding at the Court of
Paris, and named First President.
