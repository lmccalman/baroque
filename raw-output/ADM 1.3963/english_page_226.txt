Levant, while awaiting our great
Armament of next Spring.
If War takes place, as everything
Seems to announce it.
     It is not believed that M. Mackino
Will be named to the Intendancy of
Rochefort, it is thought that it Will be
rather M. Le Moine, who performs
here the functions of Commissary
Ordonnateur.
