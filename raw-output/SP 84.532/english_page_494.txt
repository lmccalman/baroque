N° 84

Paris, April 22, 1793.

It is reported from Rochefort on the
that the Advice-boat l'Espérance, which was transporting
to Brest from Franche-Paye, with destination
to Nantes, set sail on the 30th of December.
It is written from Toulon, on the 14th, that the Frigates
in the Roads were only awaiting the wind, to
set sail.

The Letters from Brest of the 17th, announce
up to the Departure of no Vessel of
War; consequently, no
Convoy has arrived upon leaving the Marine, they have
cut back Five Million in Expenses;
they are going to send him Mr. de Brogner
Solmon and Officer, all the more so that they
wish to increase the Expenses; it is
not the Means of the Marine that give
him embarrassment; but the
Comptroller General has given to [des]
frivolous and mad ones.

The King has not left Versailles
for 18 Days, they wanted [l'huis] of
Choisy for three or four Days.

It is reported that the Princes are in Case
[Remisjon] yesterday, and went to Versailles.
They were Representations to register them.
They will return from their Lands in time.
