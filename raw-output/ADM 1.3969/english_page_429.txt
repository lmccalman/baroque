Paris the 5th November 1704.

The Impatience of our Politicians is
at its height, vexed at seeing nothing arrive
from Brussels, they set Men at
odds, have the Prince of
Ligne fight at Lécluse, &c.; however it is quite
certain that this General will undertake nothing
without having the orders from his Master;
and perhaps even at this moment has he
not yet received them. In Brussels
one is not very worried, however
preparations are being made, one works
to fill in the Brooks: If it depends only
on that, the good offices of the
King. His Majesty employs them with a
warmth quite worthy of the pacific
Sentiments by which She has always been
animated; & to this effect it is assured that the King
has written himself to the Emperor to
be most pressing to engage him
to bring about terms of accommodation
which will prevent the consequences of a Quarrel

with
