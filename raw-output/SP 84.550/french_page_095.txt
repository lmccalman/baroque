Rotterdam, 19th March 1778.

Sir

In Answer to the Honour
of your Letter to me of the 15th Instant,
I must observe to you, that the Beer
in question, is not made by [a named]
Person in Holland, but in Germany;
speaking of the Price, I have
mentioned Florins of the Empire,
which, as to Flour, I think is 5 per
Cent more than Dutch Guilders.
this is to be observed, Both as to
the Difference in the Price, and
as to the Charges attending its
coming down to Holland from
a Distance. And, that in
Consequence thereof, it can not
be procured [for?] as might be
expected, coming only from Holland.
