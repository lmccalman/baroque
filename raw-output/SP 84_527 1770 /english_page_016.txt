at St Germain to see if she would not return, but
after this time I departed in the greatest sorrow
and I went to Paris to my aunt's who received me with
her usual kindness

I remained there about three weeks during which
I had the happiness of learning that my dear Sophie had
returned to St Germain. I went there immediately
and I had the satisfaction of seeing her. She told me
that she had been obliged to absent herself for some
affairs which concerned her family, but that at present
she was free and that nothing could separate us anymore

I spent another six weeks with her in a perfect
union, but alas! this happiness was not to last. One day
when she had gone out to go to Paris, she was attacked
on the road by thieves who stripped her of all that
she had and mistreated her so severely that she fell
ill. She was brought back to her home in a deplorable state
and despite all the care that I had given her, she died
after fifteen days, leaving me in the most frightful
desolation. I thought that I would not survive her, and I
was a long time in a state that bordered on despair
I did not know what to do nor where to go, and it was only after
much time that I determined to return to my
aunt's who had again the kindness to receive me
