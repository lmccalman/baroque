Letter from a Friend

Rotterdam, June 25, 1778.

A Letter from Berlin
reports that they are truly expecting
the Grand Duke of Russia there, with Prince
Henry, who has so well captivated
the spirit of this young Prince, that he
[se mefait de lui], and shows him what he
wants. The Favorites, and some
Grandees of the Imperial Court have
opposed this journey, but it was
necessary to yield to the irresistible
desires of the Grand Duke.

It is added, that the poor Favorite
Orlenhein has been relegated to Siberia,
without the Motive for this
Severity being known.
