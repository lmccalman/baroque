N°3                                                                                           Paris 22 July 1746

My Lord,
      I have received with much gratitude the letter that Your Serene Highness did me the honor of writing to me on the 8th of this month. I am very sensible of the kindnesses with which You are pleased to honor me, and I shall always esteem myself very fortunate to be able to show You my lively gratitude through my services. I wish with passion that the operations of the Campaign may procure for Your Serene Highness new occasions to distinguish Your valor and Your military talents which have acquired for You so great a reputation. I am persuaded that the army which You command will do things capable of immortalizing Your name and of meriting You immortal glory. This is what I wish with all my heart, and I dare to flatter myself that Your Serene Highness will be pleased to continue Your kindnesses toward me and to inform me from time to time of what may pass of interest in the army. I shall be infinitely obliged to You for it, and I shall always hasten with the greatest zeal to give You on my side all the news that may be agreeable to You. I am with a very profound respect,

                                                                                                  My Lord
                                                                                                  Of Your Serene Highness
