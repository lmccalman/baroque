Sir


I only had time last Saturday to acknowledge
the receipt of the letters that you did me
the honor of writing to me on the 10th and the 13th of March
past because I only received them at the moment of
the departure of the Post. It is with very great
satisfaction that one learns here that things go so
well in England. I wish very much to
encourage those for. You the honor the day before yesterday
to put in your hands after putting myself in [deuit] in the manner
that you ordered me, to present to the King


to Mr. Secretary of State Vernon
