We departed the next day from this
dwelling around five o'clock in the morning,
& after having traveled about four leagues
along the way, we arrived at the edge
of a small River, which we crossed
by ford. We found ourselves then in
a large Savanna covered with grasses &
brushwood; we crossed it, &
we entered a thick woods, where
we walked for two hours.
We were very bothered there by
the great quantity of Mosquitoes which
tormented us without cease. Around
eleven o'clock we left this woods,
& we found ourselves in another
Savanna larger than the first.
