and the Turks, which appears inevitable,
despite all that has been said until now
that the peace would not be troubled between these
Powers. The Emperor does not yet take

We have learned that the King
[Personage] will go to see the Duke of Holstein,
Duke of Mahon.

Among the [Pultava] have
perished aboard the Schurine the Prince of
[Ranuzki], his wife the Count of [Romay]
and his wife, the Count of [Tieroux],
the Chevalier [Prot]. &c. &c.

There are Two [Sclavres] which have sunk
at sea, 20 leagues from the Isle of [Flore],
one of which named the [Etats de Planding]

and
