Liège the 3rd February 1775.

I am informed from
Berlin, that [loin] there was in Paris, that when
Counselors were making their [des limoins]
to the Chamber of the conflict of Brittany, that
the Siege of [l'egeè-salons], that the officers
have retaken them; that this Siege had
[tertemant] for the [Mauride] of the [Genois]
[Royès] who commands it, and that it
[n'envoyois] every day.

I am assured that it is the Sisters of the
King of Poland who have inherited the [Raypfes].
All the gazettes are full of Letters
campaigns against the Turks.

I am written from [Laim lieu], that the Emperor
has declared to the Porte, that [l'ane] would
absolutely not want any Liaison with
France; and that for the rest she was
the Mistress to do all that she
judges appropriate in relation to Her
Possibilities.

Every day one awaits the [Dédables]
of the Parlements, & the Resentments,
which make a [peine tentation], not
only in the Capital, but
in
