Secretary of State to the Lord Mayor of
London, to inform the City, that on the
of December, Letter of dismissing the Lord
of Spain, had been presented by our
Majestys order examined by warrant
examined in the Stocks.

He sent out then, high Constables and
five of the Water, overseers the Banks
of the Banks of the Rivers Lock and
Weal, as in both Rivers the Ice has
accumulated and left so much, as to
obstruct their Course; and gives
Apprehensions for very considerable
Inundations.

I take the Liberty to condole your
Lordship upon the Death of the Duke of
Bedford, in whom I lose a Patron!
and I may say a friend of 35 Years
standing!

I have the honour to be most Respectfully,
                My Lord
                        Your Lordships
                        Obedient humble and
                        most Obedient Servant

                                    R.W. Horn.
