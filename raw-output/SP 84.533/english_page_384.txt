One only speaks to him for some
days, of the Magnificence of the Retinue
of Prince Louis the Bourbon, named
Ambassador of France to Our Court,
and of the great Expense that he must make
here. This would in some Manner
dishonor the Public of the Memory
of his Predecessor.

One makes here Remarks on the
Singularities that there are in the Choice of
Our Envoy to the Court of Berlin, and of
that of the said Court to Ours:
Baron van Knifstein, Our Envoy
to Berlin, is Son of the First Physician
of Our Court, Dutch by Nation:
Baron d'Edelheim Envoy of Berlin
to Our Court, is Native of Hanau, where
his Father has the title of Privy Counselor,
but his Grandfather who was [Surolois]
came there during the Government of the
Father of Philip Grand Count of
Hanau, and made him Intendant of the Salts
at the Court, which was a good Employment. Sir
