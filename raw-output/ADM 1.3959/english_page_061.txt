                                                Paris the 6th April 1772.

                                                            It is reported from
Toulon on the 26th, that already the new
Arrangements have caused a decrease in the
Hotels de la Continuité, des Dauphin,
and de S. Jacques, there are even two
of them closed. The Hotel de la Couronne.
It is known that there are still 4 or 5 of the 104 Thousand
Livres for the Hotels, that is to say:
to give Pensions, but the
number of them will not
be refused.

                Doctors to Paris for the Levant,
                the two who have returned from it, have
                a [bois de Gavrouches]. There is
                no question of other Arrangements,
                one speaks only of the new Arrangements,
                all the Officers are discontented,
                from the first to the last.

                Similar to a Charlatan from Paris
                who sells Rice, but it was rejected.
