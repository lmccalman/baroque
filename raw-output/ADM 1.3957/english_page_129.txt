Toulon the 22nd March 1770.

Mr. de Boynes has
commanded M. Pliche, [ma me qui] he has
arrived at Livorno, that he found there a
Russian Vessel of 66 Cannons, a frigate of 40,
and another of 22, the Pliche saluted the first,
they returned the salute Shot for Shot, all passed
to complete satisfaction, and presently some of the
officers.

We have just received order from the Ministers
to suspend the Demolition of the Vessels
the Centaur, and the Altier, we do not know why,
for they are most certainly condemned.

M. Sailly has returned from his voyage
to the Shipyards, he has ordered masts
one of 74, which will be called the St. Esprit.

There is one of the Squadron Chiefs of the Port Troops
fired upon against Rebels, there were
39 men killed or wounded of the Regiment of
Champagne, the Bandits infest more
than ever this Isle, there are daily
Assassinations on the Roads, and
Thefts.
