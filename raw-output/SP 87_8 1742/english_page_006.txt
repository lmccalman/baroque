cost us the [?] for the pleasure of seeing them, and of
hearing them sing, they are very pretty and sing marvelously we
would have very much liked to have some of them but they were so expensive
that we could not accommodate ourselves with them. we went to see
also the King's Gardens which are magnificent, the greenhouses there are
superb and filled with all sorts of foreign plants the most
rare and the most curious, we spent a large part
of the day there with much satisfaction. yesterday we went
to see the Church of St Sulpice which is one of the most beautiful Churches of
Paris, it is of a noble and majestic architecture, the paintings
with which it is adorned are of great value. we also went to the
Comedie Françoise where we saw performed l'Ecole des Maris by
Moliere and les Plaideurs by Racine, the actors performed marvelously
and made us laugh a great deal. we will go one of these days to the Opera
to hear the Italian Music which is in great reputation
here. we made acquaintance yesterday with Mr and Mrs Durand who
are our compatriots, they showed us a thousand kindnesses and
offered us their services which we will not fail to profit from in
the occasion. they told us that they would introduce us to several
persons of their acquaintance who could be useful to us during
our stay here. we invited them to come dine with us one
of these days and they accepted our invitation with pleasure.
