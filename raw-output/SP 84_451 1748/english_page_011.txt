taken the current affairs, I can assure that
from thirteen days until this day I have not had any
neither note, nor letter, nothing in a word neither from Paris nor
from elsewhere that has the slightest relation to us, and I do not know what to
judge of it, I do not complain of this negation or else then what
falls to me of it, that this will not delay things.
I do not doubt that you have communicated to
Mr. du Hautchamp as well as to my brother Bernard
what I have indicated to you about their coming here and I
am awaiting one or the other, I am
very eager to have new clarifications from you. I
do not doubt the commission with which you have charged me
for the lady so that it be done at the right time, I have
already that at the second time I have written to the [cureus] and
if he does not give response to it I will write about it to the bishop
to my brother Bernard I say a word to him about the affairs
but of those nevertheless up until the time when I
spoke to him about it by mouth                         1828 Xbre
