L. 11. Mar. No 1

               Paris the 21st February 1782

                    There is nothing new
from our Ports.
                    Mr de Vergennes has been named
President of the Council of Finances,
a Position that Mr de Maurepas had held.
                    Mr d'Adhémar will leave for
London around the Beginning of
next Month.
                    There has just appeared an
Ordinance of the King, dated the 15th of January
last concerning the Formalities
to be observed for the Remittances of
Notes, or Ransom Agreements,
as well as Hostages, which will be
made in contravention of the ordinance
of the 30th of April 1781. The title of this
Ordinance indicates its object,
which is no longer interesting today
now that Hostilities have ceased.
