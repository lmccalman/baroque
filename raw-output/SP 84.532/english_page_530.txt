you will survive him: truth has found
interpreters worthy of it; you will tell
him this truth so necessary to good
Kings, because it alone consoles them
for the painful cares of the Throne: charged

will no longer reproduce themselves these Remonstrances, where reason & good faith are
equally sacrificed; where historical facts distorted, texts mutilated;
Ordinances diverted from their
true meaning, concur in vain to

alone; born of the same sentiments, cov-
ered with the same glory, you will remain
inviolably united to that supreme head
of Justice, whose soul rises with
duties, always calm & se-
