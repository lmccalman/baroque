The News which currently
occupies us, is M[onsieur] the Keeper of the Seals: The affair of the Duke
of Aiguillon, everyone prejudiced
against him, [emble] for Messieurs de la
Chalotais, there will appear only [purifants]
Enemies of this Prince, and protestors
suspect to the people, or little is lacking
thereof.

The Prince and the Peers must assemble
Friday at 10 o'clock in the Morning at the Palace
and will not be Separated until 4 o'clock after
Midnight.

There have been sent with the Modifications
the Letters Patent of Attribution of this
affair to the Parliament: The Modifications
Are, that it is to prejudice the Rights
of the Peerage, in that they have no need
of Letters Patent for the Peerage to appear
before judges: that it appears only before the
same Peers.

The Duke [ne l'ot.] that [l'appuiés] was established
to what this Modification was put, and if in
wanting to prove, that the Parliament was
not the Court of Peers, that the Twenty Two
other Parliaments were [Defendés]
presided by the King.

President Molland took the Floor and
said to the Duke of Tolignieres, that if the Parliament
was not the Court of Peers, They would make
still all the Bonds of a Secret of Robe of
Court.
