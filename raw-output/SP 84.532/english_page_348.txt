Madrid the 7 March 1793.

We have New reports,
that the Ministers of Dominican
of the Countries of Aragon, to the Number of 30. Thousand
have [tendu de longs ranches] Oran, but
that they have been repulsed with a Loss
of 6. Thousand.

The rumors of the People continue to tell
me, that everything remains in the same State,
and that one awaited from Moment to another
Orders to stop them.

One writes to me from Cadiz, that one there expects
generally to [Espanion], that one
will not disarm so Soon the Fleet which is
ordered there, and that one also fears that one
had taken back all the Cables three Months
in advance, and that it appeared apparently
that Spain had a Cruiser
in [Sulle].

In Cadiz by the Orders of Mr Vannal,
have entered into the Country of Cadiz
[Surgis] of Artillery and a very
Munitions of War.

The Cavalry which is found in the
Environs of Cadiz, has received Order to depart from there.
