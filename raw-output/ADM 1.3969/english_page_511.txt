Madrid the 27th December 1784.

We have been informed
here for about a fortnight, that
General Elme had filled in the port
of Sura, and destroyed by bombardment
most of the country houses
of the Dey, and of private individuals of Tunis,
while awaiting considerable reinforcement
from the Republic; for further
undertakings against this Regency.

It is written from Barcelona on the 29th of
last month, that a pinque coming from Genoa
with glass for the Willelmey guards
having been pursued and attacked by
an Algerian corsair, the [Tribals] had
made such terrible fire upon them with
musketry, and some small
pieces of artillery, that the pirates
had been obliged to release their prize
in the Gulf of Juan.
