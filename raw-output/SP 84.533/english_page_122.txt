EDICT OF THE KING,

CARRYING OUT the suppression of the Parliament of Douay.

Given at Compiegne in the month of August 1771.

Registered in Parliament on the seventeenth of August one thousand seven hundred seventy-one.

LOUIS, by the grace of God, King of France and of
Navarre: To all present and to come; GREETINGS: The motives
which determined Us to make in the administration of
Justice that We owe to our Subjects, Changes
that the utility of our Peoples and our own rendered
more and more necessary, have also led Us to fix
our gaze upon those Provinces of our Kingdom
which have particular rights and deserve attention. Having had represented to Us
the Capitulations which were granted to the Peoples of our Pro-
vinces of the Low Countries by the late King, our very honored Lord and Great-
grandfather, as well as the titles of the Establishment of our Parliament of Douay,
We have recognized that the venality of Judicial Offices had
no place in said Provinces, when they were reunited to the
French Monarchy, and that the newly conquered Peoples requested and
obtained in these provinces, as being one of the privileges of which
they obtained the conservation, and that We wish likewise to maintain
and conserve in all their integrity; that the late King our very honored
Lord and Great-grandfather created, by an Edict of the month of April 1663, a Superior
Council in the City of Tournay, to receive and judge appella-
tions, or judge Royal cases, and exercise at the Presidial Council of Ghent,
and subsequently at the Sovereign Council of Malines; that the jurisdiction of this
Superior Council was augmented by all the Cities which were withdrawn from the
jurisdiction of the Parliament of Metz, by Edict of the month of August one thousand six hundred
seventy-eight; that this Council obtained the title and denomination of
Parliament of Tournay, by Letters Patent of the month of February
one thousand six hundred eighty-six; that it was transferred to the City of Cam-
bray, by an Ordinance of the twentieth of August one thousand seven hundred nine; &
