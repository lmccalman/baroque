in which Mr du Buc would have taken or sunk
3 English Vessels: but this
news appears very uncertain to me as well as
that which is being spread, Without Anyone [knowing] from
where it comes, that a King's Vessel has
taken an English Indies Vessel, and sunk
a Second one.

One is very impatient to have
news from Mr du Buc.

The St Michel coming from St Domingue
has returned to Brest, and has
encountered nothing on the Route.

The Ordinance for the increase
of Dragoons appears; the Companies
will be brought to 40 men, and the
Regiments to 4 Squadrons.

Mr le Chevert who commanded
at the Camp near Metz has died extreme-
ly mourned.

The great fall of the Company's Stocks
and the Discredit of Royal Papers
make one regard War as
very imminent.
