Considerations
upon the German Settlers that have for several
years past come to Germany to His Majesty's
Dominions in North America.

1.) The Spirit of Emigration began in the Palatinate
in the Tempestuous days of the Slantery, when the
Persecutions drove a great Number of the Protestants
Inhabitants from the Names, some settled in the
Vicinage of the House of Brandeburg, but the
most considerable Number transported to New
York at the Expence of Her late Majesty of England,
in the last Years of the Reign of Queen Anne.

2.) In the two following Reigns Groonenden kept
two Instances of Refugees being transported from
hence to America at the Expence of the Publick,
the one that of the Saltsburgers and Vaudois to
Georgia; the other of Germans or different
Sects or the Cantons to Halifax & left at the Peace
of Aix la Chapelle.

3.) The second Season by which the first Germans
were sent to their Countrymen of their Reception
and Usage, and the Accounts that Cowley,
and the Pennsylvans, both Palatinate Cantons
in their own Native Country of encouraged the
Spirit of Emigration, led avaricious to profit the
Palatinate the other Parts of the Empire, such
as Wirtenberg, Wirtemberg &c.; and to the Year
1749, great Numbers of Germans came down to
Rotterdam
