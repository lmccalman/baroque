The Rumor spread yesterday at
Versailles that there would not be a
Council of War for the affair
of the 12th of April. The Reason given
for it, is that the Depositions of
Mr. de Saudreuil are anything but
favorable for the Accused.
It is assured that Mr. d'Aubeterre
presented to the King a Memorial
in order to be exempted from presiding over the
Council of War, which must pronounce
upon the said Affair of the 12th of April.
If the Council of War takes place, it is
believed that from the moment they are
assembled, Mr. des Graffes will have the
Liberty to publish his Memorial
for the instruction of his Judges.
That of Mr. Bougainville is
also quite ready to appear, as well
as that of Mr. d'Aimar.
The News from Marseille had
prepared us for new
Disasters that Meslinel has experienced;
the Courier from Genoa has confirmed them.
