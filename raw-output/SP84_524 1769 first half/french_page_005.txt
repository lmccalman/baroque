vis—


I have the honour to bid you in the
enclosed Priv. letter a further confirmation
when I have had the honour to send you by
the last mail

Private letters from Dreux and Rochester—
fully confirm the contents of those two letters.
I have the honour to be with great truth—

                                          Sir—
                                                    Your most humble
                                                    and most obedient
                                                              R Watson.
