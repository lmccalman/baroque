Madrid the 14th November 1785.

                I am written to from Cadiz,
that the Court has appointed to convoy
the fleet destined for the Indies, the
Warships the Pelayo, the America
of 64, and the Dragon of 40 pieces of Cannon;
the first in the capacity of Captain
and the second as Admirals of the
fleet; but the time of Departure
was not yet fixed.
                My Letters from Ferrol, and from
Cartagena continue to inform me
that it remains there in inaction:
and that nothing of
note occurs there.
