Proposition delivered in writing on the 28th by
Ed Mt R. Johnston, then chosen Counsellor and Burgomas
ter of Haarlem in the City Council of the present year
(assembled) to make a nomination according
to annual custom, for to be chosen by His
Highness for the place of Pensionary,
which by pension the Burgomaster did not think
proper that shuld be read or opened, so that that
by its not entering into consideration, the Naming
of Burgomasters went on as usual.

Right Worshipful Lords!

It is well known to all the Inhabitants of this Country and
much more so to the Magistrates, how near the Republic was
brought to its destruction, at the time of His Highness's Election,
at that time it was, that roused by the hostile french Invasion of
Dutch Flanders, first the People of Holland, and soon another
of Holland, and of the other Provinces asked,
for all that time, and for that only, a Chief, a chief Stadtholder, and
he only to see that Prince raised to the Stadtholdership was so
general, that it astonished those all the Towns and Villages.

Your Worship, seeing the Danger at a distance, to obviate
it, nothing else (by wisely) fought a refuge, in the [?] nomination
of Mr R. J. [Johnston?] as Governor and .....

Since that time upon Choice has not only been compleatly
disappointed, upon him all the discomposure that he has [?]
which done, from his hand of Providence, who
has instead the blessings upon this Peace and upon the whole
Council, family, in so much, that by this means we have been delivered
from the Danger that hung over our heads.
