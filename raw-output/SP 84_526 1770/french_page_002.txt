Rotterdam 3 Janu[a]ry 1740

My Lord


I take the liberty to send inclosed to your
Lordship the Account of my Disbursements for
Secret Services for the Quarter ending the
last of December 1738, which at the
Currency of Exchange of this Day makes £289. 9. -
Sterling, for which Sum I presume by the next
Post to draw upon William Davies Esq of the
Treasury, my Bills payable 20 Days after Date
to the Order of Messieurs William Davotson
and Company.

My Patrons prudence has guided me,
that I may depend upon the Same and
Attention of his Excellencie in the french
Court, particularly in the Enclost Catalogue of
all the Opring Zijns end there.

I have the honour to be most Respectfully

My Lord

your Lordships
most humble and
most Obedient Servant
