Whitehall 25th March 1770

Sir

Having mentioned to the
Earl of Rochford the information
you gave me in your former
Letter, that great use was
made in Holland of the late
Report that the interest has been
diminished upon a part of two millions of
the money granted to pay off the
Arrears for the purpose of
depreciating the Credit of Our
Funds I have his Lordships
Directions to enable you to
contradict it upon the Authority
of a solemn Act that there are
no Arrears whatever bearing
Charge having been some time
since, paid up to the time to
last, I have at the same time
his Lordships Commands
to thank you for your
attention to this matter, and
