Paris the 19th April 1778.

Our letters from Brest
say, that there is no longer question
of Armament, that the works have
been slowed down with ill humor, but slowly.
We have no News of
Mr. Du Chaffault's Squadron,
no doubt that the Duke of Chartres'
indisposition has had no
consequences, since he has not
yet disembarked at Quiberon,
as he was expected there.
The people in charge of the Offices
for the Distribution of Tickets
of the New Royal Lottery
of France, are obliged to furnish
each a Bond of
15 Thousand livres; which gives a
[Regratteur] the Liberty to make
their Advances to the King, of
2 Million 600 Thousand livres
without putting up funds.
