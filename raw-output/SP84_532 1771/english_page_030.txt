December, the 2nd, May 1771

Sirs

Your letter of April 8th from the Commander
of the Watch, that from the Town of France
of the 7th and that from the Controller of the Lande Domain
of the 8th inform me to what degree
the disputes of these
gentlemen have reached; you may tell both
parties that I await the titles of this
property of the Watch. On one side and the other
people speak of well-established rights and show
only later documents; it is
the light that you have
provided us in this regard that can help us
advance the decision in this
matter; which I hope for from a knowledge
of the ancient Titles that will establish quite
positively the true Proprietor.
I confess to you that I do not understand
how the Officers of the different Corps
have not yet written to the Council to
bring to its attention an affair so
important.

Vielleville de Perri,
The Grand Lord of the King,
De Montigny Intébre
