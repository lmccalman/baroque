Brest, September 11, 1778

They are working to completely
remake the Ship la Bretagne,
and they are putting in the Basins
the St Esprit, and the Glorieux, in the
Place of the Palmier and the Blanche,
which are leaving today.
The Work that is done in the
Basins, is very good, but
that which is done on the Waters
is worth nothing
       Under the [Armenonces] of
this Year I [relaireront] to
the Fitting out of 3 or 6 Frigates,
for the Islands in the month of October
next.
       L'Intrepidité has arrived
from the Cape, and has not brought back
Mr de Bruney.
