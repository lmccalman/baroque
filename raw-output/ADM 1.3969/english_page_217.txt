All the Plenipotentiary Ministers
dined afterwards at M. de Vergennes's,
the Ambassadors of the States General
and the Ministers of the United States
had come from Paris to Versailles
for this purpose.

We learn by the land route,
that the English knowing that
M. de Suffren was approaching, and that
M. de Bussy had disembarked at
Gondelcour, have entirely ruined
Negapatnam.

We have seen the dispatches
from Constantinople of last June 8th,
the Turk had not yet
notified his Manifesto to the Divan.

The King has already named the officers
to hold the Council of War, for
the affair of April 12th, which will be held
at Lorient, and will be presided over by the
Count de Bouguen.
