the Act registered at the Lit de Justice on the 7th of December last.

     A letter from a Former Magistrate has been attached to it,
a Duke and Peer of France, in which the exposed
Chancellor is redone, phrase by phrase, and it is proven that the decree of
the Parlement, which he calls an innovation, goes back more than three
Centuries. If the Council should raise against this petition, as is expected,
it will make it even more famous.

     The return of the courier from
Madrid is awaited with impatience: it is certain that the King desires, and wants Peace.
