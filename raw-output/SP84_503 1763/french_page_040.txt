Rotterdam 9ber 29th 1763

My Lord


I have the honour to send your Lordship
inclosed an exact list of the French Navy
with many particulars which we have
no hitherto had, and which my correspondent
assures me came from Commissionors of the
Navy in the three departments of Brest,
Rochefort and Toulon.
