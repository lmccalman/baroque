Toulon, September 4, 1776.

          I will seek from Mr. de
Martelly, nothing better [on lygeles]
to [forendre] some Provisions.
          The [Ecluse] continues its Loading
for Brest.
          The Minister has written, that as the
Vessels of Bourgogne, and the
first Frigates, are ready, the King
wants that the projects of the Belle Poule,
[pour en par jour autant qu'il se [?]
pourra] of the others, and in Consequence
not to send away the force workers
who are in the Port.
          One prepares for the artillery of the
Bourgogne, which needs a good
talent. One will want to complete [Montagne
d'grand Suny], for exact [changette].
          One continues the Careening of the Languedoc,
as well as to the Formant, the Directeur,
the Bienvenu, the Casque, the Lion, and the Renaud,
There is nothing to do to all these
Vessels

                                                    On,
