The News that we have
from Places situated on the Loire are
Most distressing; this River has risen
so suddenly by the Thaw that it
has broken its Dikes in Different
places, the Loss in Wines, Sugars,
Coffees, Liqueurs, &c. is immense;
few Boats have been preserved
and the Damage is already estimated at Two
Million, Five Hundred Thousand Livres.

Among the Number of Vessels
that the recent Hurricanes have
thrown on our Coasts, one names the
Gaston, which was coming from Port au
Prince, richly loaded; it
perished Body and Goods on the Coast of
Belle-Isle; there were on board eleven
Passengers.
