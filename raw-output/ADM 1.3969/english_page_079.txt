Port Louis the 20th April 1782.

The Vessels which have
set sail for India and China,
are the King's Frigate la Meduse, the
Flutes l'Amphitrite, l'aventure, le petit
Emoin, and the private Ship le Grand
Duc des Toscane. The Frigate la Sensible,
which was found to be out of condition to make
the Voyage to China, has been replaced
by the private Ship la Comtesse
de Marbes, which has taken the Name of Sensible.

The King's Flute la Pintade, destined
for America, will not delay in
setting sail, as well as le Chancelier de
Brakant, large Merchant Vessel,
loaded on the King's Account, destined
for the Isle de France.

There is talk here of the Franchises of our
Port, and of that of Orient, in favor of the
[Indix] United States. But it is only after
the Conclusion of some Peace, that one
can Enjoy this Matter.
