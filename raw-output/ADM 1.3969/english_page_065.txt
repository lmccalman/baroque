N° 17 and N° 2

          According to the latest Letters
from Brest, fire broke out at one of the principal
Magazines of Bray, which had caused the
most disastrous Ravages, without the most
prompt aid, and the best organized.
They managed to stop the Progress of the Fire,
so that only one Provisions Depot
was burned. The Loss is estimated at One
Hundred Thousand écus.

The War Council being occupied at
Brest with the Trial of Mr. the Viscount, returned
from Cadiz by the Fleet, who awaits his
Judgment without Fear.

It appears that there reigns a great
Jealousy throughout the Fleet of Mr. d'Estaing
between the regular Officers, and the Auxiliary
Officers. These Former have written to
Mr. d'Estaing to complain about the
preferences given to the latter.
But it is thought that our Minister
will consider reforming this Proud Corps,
where Indiscipline reigns so strongly.
