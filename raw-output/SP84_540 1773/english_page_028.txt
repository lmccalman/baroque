to read, to bring back my hands
to the extremity of the universe where tomorrow would be
to make [Botzart]. But
which Petrarch make the [brocme] to the
[chambrains]? Under which Petrarch?
truly, you say, there is a theme
that is well made! Under the [Palmias],
Under the easiest Petrarch.
Where must I bind myself, founded, to make
the [brocme]? Is he happy!

He no longer draws anything today,
we must wait for what
will happen to us.
