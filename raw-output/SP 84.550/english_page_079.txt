N°. 20.

Paris the 4th March 1776.

The Count of St
Germain being honored, like her,
by the [ma] of Monsieur gave
public audience in
the antechamber of the Minister, the
whole affair was heard in the
most honest fashion that this
Director of War affects to conduct
everything. Having heard, he received the
Memoirs, with kindness of emi-
nence complaisance to the Marshal.
this new Director worked
today with the King. Mr de St
Germain is doing well, it is not
a dislocation of the spine, as
was feared; there is hope
that he will be restored soon.
This indisposition does not prevent
him from working in his Cabinet.
