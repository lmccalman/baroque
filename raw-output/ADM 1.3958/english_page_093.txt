                    Brest the 20th January 1775.

                              We have in these
past days a Beautiful Shallop, which
the King gives to Sr Cavarois, who makes
that of St Malo, had installed by the slipway
by the hauling, full and sure; there they make some
boiling Water, and it was at
best.
    The Alexandre Was Launched at the first
Tide, these two Vessels well
constructed by Mr Olivier, and they
appear excellent.
    The King has not yet given any
Orders relating to the Peace, our works
go their course. The Corps of the
Navy is vexed that the War
does not take place, it alone can
give some Consideration
to this Corps.
