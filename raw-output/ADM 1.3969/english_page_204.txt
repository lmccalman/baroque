Madrid, April 11, 1782.

The Court received the day before
yesterday Dispatches from Don Solano
dated the 8th of the Current month, by a Vessel
arrived at Cartagena or at Alicante.
These Dispatches report, that after having
struggled during all of last Month
against contrary Winds, and
Calms, He had arrived in the
Bay of Algiers on the 5th of the Current month;
and that at the Departure of the Vessel
dispatched with this News, a
Part of the City of Algiers was
on fire, and in flames. The R-
had seen only Four Wounded
Men in its Vessels.
It is hoped here, that M. Barcelo will have
reinforcement by the Prizes & Gunboats
or Bomb vessels, which
were [paroles] by the rough Weather
come from the Galleys of Malta, from
Genoa,
