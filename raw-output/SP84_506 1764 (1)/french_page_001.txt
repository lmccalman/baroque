I see with great pleasure that since the Signing of the Preliminaries no new Ships have been put upon the Stocks excepting the few that were given in present to the King, and even most of those were begun building before the End of the war. They expect that when Mr de Laverdy has settled his matters, a new life will be put into their Navy.

I have the Honour to be with great truth

Sir

                                        your most humble
                                        and most obedient Servant

P.S. If any Altercation in                    R W Otter
the Destination of the Sceptre
Solitaire and Union, we shall
hope know it in time.
