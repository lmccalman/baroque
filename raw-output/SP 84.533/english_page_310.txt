N°. 90.

                                                Paris the 28 November 1775.

                                                One still sees nothing
appear of the great Events that
were to follow the registration of the Laws
of Fontainebleau.
    It is certain that there are several Edicts
sent to the Parliament, but one does not
know which one the Court will transcribe. It is
that however of the Municipal charges
is sent there, one will fix the last of the
new Declarations of Property:
for the Payment of the Vingtiemes.
    Like these Declarations, the making of
[festes] the Receipts of the Domains of
the year. One will increase the Revenues
in all the Kingdom, rather than
diminish them by the News from Paris and
an Increase of Six Hundred Thousand Livres.
These Increases are destined for the
Payment of the Wages of the Magistrates
of the New Parliaments, and of the
Superior Councils.
    Our Parliament refused on the 10th its
Registration of an Edict, which formed
the death of time of M. Thourage of
[?] and proper and the North; one had joined
to that held the Marquis de la Mesnigere
and of the St. Chapelle. This S. is Journal 183.
