at Louisbourg the 10th June 1758.

On the Point of Departure of
the Comette, I hasten to tell you, that the
English have made their Landing at the place
of Bayville Gabarus, where they were not expected
at all; they thought to take the Town right
away. They landed the 8th at four o'Clock
in the Morning, and they were so close to the Town
at 8 o'clock, such that the Canon of the Cavalier
fired Upon Them. They were 6 Thousand; they
have from 12 to 18 Thousand Men, who Are
Surely all on Land.
Mr de Gourcourt does not want to
let us Leave, and we Will be taken or Blown up.
