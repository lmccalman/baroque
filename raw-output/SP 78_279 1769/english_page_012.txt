Sir, I Know perfectly that I fail in the most Sacred duty toward You, in not giving you
my news more often, and this will appear to You all the more Astonishing that I have the honor of
Writing to You as regularly as I do, but to justify my conduct, it suffices me to tell You that the
multitude of my occupations does not permit me to Satisfy my Eagerness. I received Your Letters of the
8th and 15th of last month, and I had the honor of responding to You on the 22nd, by which You indicated to me that
You had received my previous ones of April 1st. I See with pleasure that You are satisfied with my operations,
and that You approve the measures that I have taken. I can only congratulate myself on Your approbation which
will always be for me the greatest encouragement. I will continue my Efforts to merit more and more
Your confidence, and to justify the choice that You were pleased to make of me. I pray You to be persuaded
that I will always put the greatest Zeal and the greatest activity in all that will concern Your
interests, and that I will neglect nothing to give You proofs of my attachment and of my respectful
devotion.
