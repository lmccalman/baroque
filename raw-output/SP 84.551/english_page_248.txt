frank, and would provide the Minister of
guards the complaints. Mr. de St. Germain
has worked since with the King,
and has not complained; but
some days after, because of
the false predictions that
are always made to him, he asked
His Majesty to give him his
leave. And She refused him quite
flatly, saying that one must not
lose courage, when touching
upon the end of a work.

However, I foresee that the
Semblyon would have been accepted,
because of all that the King
has to suffer in relation to his
operations, if the King had
by whom to replace him. Mr. de
Castries is good; the [Barqs],
but I foresee very few agreeable
to the Nation, which does not like him.
