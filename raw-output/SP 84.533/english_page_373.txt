important for the King, with their
movements.
    The day before yesterday at Bizet, they held
the Sale of 80 Plows of the Two Bishoprics of the
Dukes of Orleans, and they sold them at
Auction, this Prince makes a Reduction
of a Fifth on the [Barrisons], Cages,
and Appointments that he pays.
    The Duke of la Vrilliere found himself very
ill from a Windy Colic of Gout;
with a Kind of Retention of Urine;
he had some affairs, he had them seen
outside; he is out of danger, and the Knight
or to say it better, the Duke Clement
who is at Court, does not presently
carry himself, not as much of Stomach.
    It has been struck for two days, and reopened
more than 30 Prisoners of the Pavilions,
as much Authors as Peddlers,
of works against the Government,
and against those of great Reputation, of
Chancellors, like those Wrecks etc.
it is a Criminal affair,
one gives little at present of
Rebels, who fall beasts
at the same time.
