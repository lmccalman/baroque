Rotterdam 7th 1790

My Lord Duke—

I am informed that last week the
Resolution was taken in the Assembly of the
States general to send to Surinam one man
per company of each Regiment of National Troops
in the service of the Republick; and one Corporal
and a Corporal out of each Regiment; and that
all officers on half pay therebelonging to the
said Colony shall have the full pay granted
them.

I do not hear that any time is fixed for
these troops sailing nor who is to command them.

The particulars thereof I hope have already
been since my last of the 30 ult. from these
Colony; ere, that the Revolted Negros were about
one hundred and fifty in number these they have
in great to
the game the Duke of Portland.          totally
