Report of the Revolutionary Committee
of Alluvies of 30 July 1793

We inform you citizens that we had
arrested yesterday evening one Pierre Blanc, merchant
of this commune, as a suspect, and this according to the
denunciations which were made to us against him, and of which
we will give you account shortly. We had
him taken to the house of arrest where he is at this moment,
awaiting that you make known to us your intentions
regarding him. We also inform you that we
had all his papers and effects seized, of which we will
send you the inventory as soon as possible.

Health and fraternity.
