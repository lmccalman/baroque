[Text at the bottom of the page:]
I will tell you with the utmost exactitude my manner of thinking regarding this event. I am fully convinced of the sentiments that you have for me, and I would be the most ungrateful of men if I were not touched by them. My sentiments for you are no less lively, and I dare say that they are of a very different nature from those that I could have for any other. I regard you as a sincere and true friend, and I flatter myself that you regard me the same way.
