one hundred ecus; paid by your Grandfather in
1717, but on the surplus that your Father
promises in 1738.
         Mr. MICHEL.
I do not see what you are getting at.
         Mr. MICHAUX.
Would you not be one of those deaf men,
husbands worse than they want to appear? Well then, Sir; read, I
pray you.
"So that Michau may know all that
belongs to him, I promise to deliver to him
the INVENTORY THAT CAN BE MADE, an
exact inventory of all that is in the
old chest that his ancestors entrusted to me.
         Mr. MICHEL.
I may read in vain, Sir, I understand
nothing of your request.
         MICHAU.
It seems clear enough to me, however. It
concerns giving me what is in the old
chest, from which 100 ecus were drawn in 1737.
         Mr. MICHEL.
What is in the old chest! There is
nothing left, my friend, absolutely nothing.
         MICHAU.
Absolutely nothing! So the uncle lies, or

         Mr. MICHEL.
It is true that his note much resembles

will give you nothing.
         MICHAU.
And when he renewed this promise in
1740?
         Mr. MICHEL.
One may still believe that he was promising
something, but....
         MICHAU.
But, Sir, open the old chest for me; I am convinced that I will find something there; unless those who have the
key.....
         Mr. MICHEL.
Useless trouble, my dear friend! Perhaps
you would find there some coins or
some old trinket; fallen into disuse.
         MICHAU.
Open it anyway, Sir, whether there be
little or much, these are my affairs. Your
distrust would make me suspect....
         Mr. MICHEL.
Believe me on my word.
         MICHAU.
Is your word worth more than the written
commitment of your Father?
         Mr. MICHEL.
Well then; since I must tell you,
my Father was mocking those to whom he made
this promise. He was quite obliged to
make it; for you might have wanted to open
