The News came from Paris to Montrouaré,
to Mr Barenot's house, and that Mr others had made a
piece. She suddenly left Versailles and
withdrew to the Convent of the Carmelites
at St Denis to make a Retreat there; She
obtained with Difficulty O.P. from the Rising of the King
her Father.

One does not know whether these Circumstances came from the
C.te Haute R.ch.t.u, which one did not expect,
that on the Eve of the Pates that were proposed
for the Marriage, She should agree to this
Enclosure within a Cloister. One is ignorant whether
there was no other Motive than Piety for O. has
led to such a sudden Retreat.

The truth However is that O.P.
V. M.e to be that she has not so seriously
all the Counts. She had planned this Retreat
to remove herself from some years that She loved;
but without Doubt that the Distance from the
Family was a Reason to choose St
Denis closer to Versailles; and that moreover
the Order of the Carmelites is more austere than
that of Fontevrault.

The C.te Haute R.ch.t.u was very inconsolable
at the Return of all the court which had made
to by since she had always had a False
[ensche] of a Boy.

The Duke of Choiseul is quite sure of what I hear
