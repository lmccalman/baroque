Brussels, September 6, 1770.

The Prince of Starhemberg
having presented himself Wednesday at the Assembly of the
States of Brabant, the Chancellor delivered
to the Pensionary an Ordinance from the
Court of Vienna, by which it is
enjoined upon the said States to render within
the Term of three Months their Accounts
of the Revenue of the last Ten Years
into the Hands of the Minister.

The Commons have declared that if
the said Accounts were to be rendered
publicly, their Body must be
admitted to the Examination, since it is
only by their Consent that the
Successive Elections have been granted.
It will be responded that it will be deliberated upon.

The same Order has been notified to the
States of Flanders, Hainaut,
Namur, and Luxembourg.
