Madrid the 4th February 1775.

Last Friday arrived
arrived here a Courier from Prince Masseran
with the News, that the Disputes between
the Courts of London and Madrid are
terminated amicably and to the Satisfaction
of both Courts. Nothing yet transpires
of the Conditions, of which I do not doubt
at all that you will be kept informed
before us.

The same Courier said, that an
Order had been sent to Mister Harrison,
to return immediately, and that one
return here.

His Revolution is in the same
Position as I marked it for you
in my previous ones.

They write to me from Cadiz, that there
are now in the Port 15 Ships
of the Line armed, and that they expect there the
12 Warships from Ferrol.
