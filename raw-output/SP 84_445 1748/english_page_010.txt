My Lord Duke

It is a great satisfaction to me to find by my
Ld worthy letter of the 21st of June Old that your Grace
is pleased to take notice of my accounts of the late
disturbances in this Province, and I shall not fail to
continue these accounts, and take the liberty to
communicate to your Grace the remarks which
the little knowledge I have of the Constitution of
this Country will lead me to make upon the good
and bad consequences which there wants may be
attended with or followed by; and I am by this very
letter going to shew the liberty which your Grace gives
me, but I hope that my good intentions will plead my
excuse.

Allthô the People of this Province are much pleased
                                                                                        to be
the Duke of Bedford.                                                           89
