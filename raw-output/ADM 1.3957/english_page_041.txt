* 317                                    Reg Tilly

                    Paris the 26th January 1770.

         There are a thousand News items
of my Sorts; a Letter from Rochefort says that
the two Ships which took refuge at the Isle of
Ré with the Poitou Regiment, were very
near to being lost and the Division of
Battles had taken refuge in various Ports of the
Council, that there is great Incubation in
Paris, yesterday chain was thrown on these outlaw
workers of la Fournie, the efforts are consequently
terrible

     And Mr de cas Arché [surprenre] the Fulfillments
of Contracts, and reduces them to some brigadiers at
the Last Price, which makes a very beautiful train
rule which [appréciant] that office of the assigned
[torisent] with their lip.     Sr André translates
the Rent Contracts of the Grand Contracts
with the clerks

     One still works on the Reductions that the
Minister of [Ordonnies] has just made, the King will have
10 Millions less to pay, and 10 Thousand fewer
other posts, which increases the Receipt, and
the fund to execute the expense of ridiculous beds, there
[compris] at least why the general expenses
of Artillery there, thus the Suppression of
Reimbursements

     One finds much bad faith, [frotter], scoundrels,
and masters and like the
Shares of people who have abused the month
