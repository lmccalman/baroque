Col. Malcolm    )  I have continued inactive ever since I have had honour
Brigadr Genl    )  last to be layalt best, 20 Sept as to offensive operations
                   It is true I have some heavy stores, but I
                   do not feel that, any within suppose that
                   friendly some mistake (but known where affairs
                   place came, it has originated) it behind that
                   he would not support the Rajah, if however
                   they should not be the case, we must take this
                   never with him, which I make no doubt will
                   ultimately prove a very successful one - at the
                   ing his guns by a late dist establish, or rather is a
                   just delay for the ruin is the dist establish at the
                   jor. My is and putting over for me to join from there
                   particulars information, than that I have attached
                   the light horse, as before comprised, and confined
                   a dept of between Brit and Brit Man, where which
                   he withdraw his Horse to some other distance,
                   and we have not yet been able to know the
                   causes of this charge considered. If he actually
                   meant to break with his, he would naturally
                   have secured his numerous Cavalry, & put
                   jeffries at best, to enter the Carnatic, as he
                   most especially considered, destroy he could join
                   us - all however in the Carnatic is still quiet
                   in that respect, atho one Horse is difficult
