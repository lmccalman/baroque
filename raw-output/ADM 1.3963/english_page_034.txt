The Committee of Messrs. Germain has
finally expressed itself entirely through
Bureaus, they agree therein by
M Cantabelle Livres; this Ministry
comprises only three heads:
who are Messrs. Sieurs Charlot,
de Pons, and Bonnevois, their
Bureaus will be established
permanently at the Arsenal in Paris;
each head has the title of Intendant
of War; they each have
60 Thousand Livres, and [leste changent]
the expenses of the Bureaus, and to have
clerks as many and as
they judge appropriate, The
Appointments will be taken from
the 60 Thousand Livres; such that,
instead of [M.] hundred Thousand Livres
that these Bureaus would cost,
they will cost only 180 Thousand
Livres
