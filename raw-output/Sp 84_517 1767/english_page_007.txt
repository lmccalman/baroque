September 29th 1787.

Mr. Withers.                                Sir

It is with the deepest Affliction I
am now to acquaint You that on
Sunday last Capt. Wotherspoon arrived
from Montserrat with the melan-
choly account that R.R.R. the
bank of York died at that place of a
malignant Fever on the 17th inst
after fourteen days severe illness.
I give you the earliest information
in my power of this unfortunate
event, the in all probability You
will have read it before the
arrival of this letter

Jamaica          H. Conway
