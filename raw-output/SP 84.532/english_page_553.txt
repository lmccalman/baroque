The King accompanied by all the family,
then Saturday at Fontainebleau, to
receive the oath of Madame the
Countess of Provence; His Majesty will also go
beforehand to S. Preims of Fontainebleau;
from there one will go to Versailles, and the
Marriage will take place on the 14th.

There are no festivities for this
Marriage, see [Monsoient] those which
were made for us at Marly; it is an
item of 6 Million less for
the Expense.

Madame the Dauphine has taken [l'effarder]
Saturday of her new Apartment;
it is that of the late Queen; she
regretted the first, which she said pleased
her [bild] at the [femepte] of the [Beurries].

It has rained horribly for
two days, which does great good
to the earth, which had dried out to a
foot of Depth. Nothing has
happened. The Hail has done no
harm to the Vines of Champagne
and Burgundy. [Il on faute qu'il
Porteront le the] is not as great
as one had announced.
