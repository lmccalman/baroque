Extract from a Letter from Ferrole.

There are two [Villes] of [Vaigamo] of
50 and 10. Pieces of Cannon at the Entrance of the Port.
The first is composed of 32. [Vaigamo],
and the Second of 4. [Vaigamo] and some
frigates. They are armed with everything, the
others are still in the Arsenal
with about 40 Men and 13. Officers.
An Order has been sent to all the Ports
to allow no Sailor to depart,
and to send them all here, as well
as the Pilots.
The Royal Council must recommence
the Fleet which must leave from this Port.
