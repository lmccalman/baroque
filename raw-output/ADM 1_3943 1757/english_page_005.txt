The latest News from Germany
tells us, that the King of Prussia was making
a Movement to march against the said Daun,
while he left a Corps of 40 to 50 Thousand
men before Münster. It is added that he
ordered Count Mr Daun [la replicira]
on the rear, to make, he says, [Ges]
Junction with the troops he is expecting;
We expect News of a Battle,
or even two, from that Side: We also hope
that the upcoming Entry of the Russians into
Prussia, will cause some Diversions
to the Protestants; but first they will want to
try the fate of an Affair.
Our Ministers are beginning to speak
more positively of the march of the Russians
but they [disconvient] the Operations of the
King of Prussia, who is preparing, it is said, to act
Against the Members of the Empire who have
declared themselves against him.
All our Army at Münster was to
be united on the 1st of this Month. We expect
News of a Battle as it is certain
that Marshal d'Estrées has Orders to march
against the Enemy as soon as he finds himself in a state
to be able to do so with Advantage
