Rotterdam the 18th July 1785

Sir,

I was honoured with your favour of
the 12th Inst. on Saturday last the 16th, and
immediately communicated the Contents
to Mr Wolters, who as well as my Son, were
at the Hague with Sir James Harris;
and by them I was acquainted with the
Resolutions taken concerning the forced
Correspondence; but as I was not informed
of any new Mode of Payment, as the
inclosed Letter from Mr Wolters will
confirm, I, with the Advice of Mr Wolters,
took the Liberty, in my own Name, to
draw upon the Treasury as customary.
