This Thursday the 14th May 1761

Sir

I would have had the honor of writing to you sooner, had it not been for the indisposition of
Madame de Lavillebruneau, thus I have been asked to tell you on her behalf and that of her
son, that the transaction which she has just made with M.r de ville, is to take from him
a house in town with a courtyard in front for a Stable, with rooms
and Stable, at a fixed price, or in case I can do nothing about it and it is not sufficient
for what she requests. I had told her well that she should not suffer any longer and
that she seems to be recovering.

I therefore send the honor of writing to you, for next Saturday
or when her health will permit her to have the honor of seeing you, the conversation
not being in the least interesting, she does not care about it for the present, and that even those who are
advantageously established, do not consider what she owes, and are careful
not to enter into agreement by the advantageous terms which they anticipate, and there is no such place that would not become
the satisfaction of this lady. It is thus that with good honors she expects an entire
recognition of your Market, [me sont cher à luy faire honte] of his abandonment and
subscription, upon which such is not their order, another who is worthy of
addressing such watches over the centuries of conduct to the highest degree already
realized, but who does not want, nor a question.
