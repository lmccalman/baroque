No 7

Paris the 88 January 1778.

The letter from Toulon
speaks neither highly in sending back the [affriands],
nor of the Passes in the Ravines, and it had a [travers]
traces that one goes there: it recommends itself
only to the promise of Monsieur the Marquis
de Bouillons in the [Mannes], that everything
will be arranged there: While awaiting this,
the Sieur on the Buildings that he has executed, and he
presses today the very ones
of which M. Roy, who returned on Friday
Evening from Toulon, to Versailles, must return
today to Marly for three Days:

The same [Dourg] to Voyages like those
of Toulon; the King's Castle: the Game, of countess
as above then:

The divisions between the Ministers continue
always; the Duke d'Aiguillon had Raged with
violence against the Chancellor and would not cease
to enter finally to last and alleged the
Regiments of Rome which augment the Two
d'Aiguillon, by whom Marshal [belle] Richelieu
was not admitted to the audience: One does not
Know when will arrive the near moment of this
change in the Ministry: one will see
in the Chancellor First Minister.
