LETTER FROM A CITIZEN,

AS you are an isolated Citizen, without ambition;

of the State, & from this ignorance would have proceeded the
[téperdité] that one would have had in submitting to them. The Small
Council was well persuaded in 1737, that there was not
                                                     A
