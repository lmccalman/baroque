printed, so that each person could know the fundamental rules and the measure of his rights.

The Regulations on wheat, wines, police and others of those of most of the States, of the Government should also be printed, they interest the public which must conform to them; and above all the Citizens and Bourgeois, who always have some part in the government, and who are by their [démission] or commerce members of the State. They are necessarily bound to the State, and Sovereign, to make order, justice, abundance reign there, and to prevent the Monopolies which reign, everywhere; reign too unfortunately in our City. There were in 1730 military Regulations made by the Small Council; they should be militarily printed and known to everyone; since they must doubtless regulate the time of exercises, the inspection of arms; the number of Officers of the Corps and their rank; that of the regiments and Companies, and their parade ground; the order and discipline of the bourgeois troops, their equipment or clothing, the service to which they are obliged; and the posts which they must occupy on occasions. The Edict of 1711, ordered all Merchants to have their partnerships registered in Chancellery; for this there is in the Chancellery a register where all partnerships are recorded, and signed by the Merchants who formed them; and the registration right is a Regulation on commerce, very judicious and very extensive; which must be from approximately the beginning of the century; this Regulation is of interest to Merchants and is very useful to them, why then is it not printed, and a Copy delivered to each of them, when they establish themselves or form their partnerships?

It is said that there is a Regulation of the Two-Hundred, which states that the Small Council cannot make an extraordinary expenditure that goes to six thousand florins, without being brought to the Two-Hundred, to be authorized; and another which states that if individuals believe themselves injured in their rights, and have some subject of complaint against the Small Council, they can have recourse to the Two-Hundred, to have it decided; whether these two Regulations exist, and if they have been observed.

The Regulations of the Two-Hundred belong to the Two-Hundred Council, and should therefore be printed and known to the Members; by means of a Copy which would be delivered to each; each would know his rights and attributions to the Small Council superior to the Council as well as to the Body of the [forte] the Registry of the Nation, and in general thus between the Magistrate and the people; instead, a State in a position to maintain its prerogatives, must prevent the usurpations that one would want to carry to [derner certifier] the conformities of Regulations prevent the Two-Hundred from making other propositions which are often contrary to the duties of the time.

Once the Regulations have been collected and compiled into a Body, added following the general Code printed in 1735, the Senate, each Master of Police, will see in which can contribute to what, the Citizen will know the rank he occupies in society, and the duties he has to fulfill in the state or Residence in the place. The Mag. Council will consult and each danger of seeing all printed, would need a book Ordinances are issued to each Citizen solely in view of the public good; right, and makes known that he wants to give as there is no reason to believe what can contribute to the happiness of the State and of individuals? In England everything is printed; the acts of Parliament are printed; the subsidies that are granted, their product, the sum, and the expenditure of the State; and the accounts that are rendered down to the sol in the Lower Chamber are printed; and even the debates that take place in Parliament the number of votes for or against the Minister; each person can make the balance sheet of the British Nation, know the enormity of its debts; and know by these printed details the least interesting facts of the Capital and the Provinces are developed and recorded in printed public writings, and spread throughout Europe by way of the Gazettes; it is a taste to generalize this Nation, that each person down to a herb seller at the market reads the news. If this publicity of laws will be more of all abuse; which everything has given the motive prejudice to this Nation so enlightened and so powerful, and which has many other subjects to manage than our small Republic?
