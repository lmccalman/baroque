N° 406.

Paris the 30th June 1775.

The Duke d'Aiguillon
entered for present affairs to the Council
of State on Tuesday. He came in the evening to Paris:
he found the antechamber with Peers who
were awaiting him. His Enemies are content with themselves
and have said nothing about it. One knows that for this
Nomination the matter of Pensions has been
consummated, and that the Parliament of Aix
Parliament is very-[des]. The Duke d'Aiguillon
will give Tomorrow Sunday an audience
to private individuals, and will give them
dinner. That already makes [des] understood.

The Marquis de Monteynard Minister
of war and other White Ministers of
affairs, are going to attack a Council
today.

The Chancellor must also enter
Council, but that will only be when the good
Dauphin will have taken Seat there, and that
because already one was on my side,
it is at the Chancellor's that the Council
would be held, and which would not be proper to go see
to Ministers more senior than he.
