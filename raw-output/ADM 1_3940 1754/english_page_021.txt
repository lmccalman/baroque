It is not at Beaux, death still remains and for the greatest part in the
multitude. The Apostle calls this death the last enemy which must
be destroyed. It is a matter of knowing if we can undo it, and here is
what we can say of it. First death is not among
the evils that we have called natural, that is to say which come
from our nature and which are inseparable from the human condition. For man
was created immortal, and if he had not sinned, he would never have died. It is
true that since sin, death has become natural to man in this
sense that it is a necessary consequence of his corrupted nature. But it
is not natural in the sense that it was attached to his nature in his first
state. Secondly death is not among the moral evils
which consist in sin itself, for death is not sin, but
the penalty of sin. It is what Scripture calls the wages of sin. It is
true that temporal death encloses within its bosom eternal death, but
these two deaths are quite different from one another. Temporal death
is only the separation of the soul from the body, but eternal death is
the separation of the soul from God. Thirdly death is not an
absolute evil without mixture. There are even things in it which are good
and advantageous to the children of God. It delivers them from all the evils
of this life, it shelters them from all temptations, it makes
them pass from this valley of tears to the dwelling place of eternal
joy. It is for this reason that the Apostle says that death is a gain for
the faithful, and that to die in Jesus Christ is far better.
