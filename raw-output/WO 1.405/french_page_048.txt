I have the honor to transmit herewith a
list of the fleet which is now fitting out on the
Spanish Ports, and also an account of the
state of the Ships at the arsenal of Ferrol
on the 5th this month.

A list of the Ships has been received this
week separately at Nancy, to proceed to here
It would appear by all the accounts that the
fleet is a Spedite at Cadiz.

Last for Don Francisco de Borgia, and the
ships a Decade San Pedro Aconda and Don
Mosquit de Fonta sailed ten at Bartagone
intend the three ships which came from here
to were to commence the Carenage Spedisson,
and no other Admirale can yet been named

By the account from Ferrol it may be
supposed that the new Ships there are by
this
