Brest the 18th November 1780.

                                    For two days
same battery, two [l'aiguilleux] have been
masted since Wednesday, the others will
be soon.

The Solitaire [fait repris] thousand of the
Basin, it will be filled there for a
matter.

The Vengeur 18 [toures] at the Biscuit.
At 8 at the [Pair gras], but the Relay will not be
[rientjours]. There are still only two
Vessels from Bordeaux arrived,
loaded with wine, the winds which have changed
make us hope to see Many.

I hope We await at La Rochelle the
Orders from the Court to depart.

There is talk of having 4 Uniforms
brought to the [grandes locles].

The [Regal] of a new [Murothon]
[en sher], makes Much Noise.

The [Brisfine] works at [jones].

The [Regal] is countermanded, the work
which is done in the Port by a similar [banal]
ought not to be long.
