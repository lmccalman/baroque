                                                were received by the Minister.
                                                So that, if Capt Fawcett
                                                had not taken the Passage
                                                in One of the Stettin Boats,
                                                We had still been ignorant
                                                of the hereditary Prince's

                                                pretty Strong We conclude
                                                that another Stettin Boat
