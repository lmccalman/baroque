The Regiments will have themselves Reconciled by various
Chaplains of the Army to satisfy the jubilee
granted by our Holy Father the Pope and published throughout
France. The large Regiments and the Captains
must retain the soldiers on Sundays and feast days
in order to give them the leisure to satisfy their
Christian duty. The commander will have notice given
to the Chaplains of the Regiments that they may
have themselves assisted by some Priests of the Clergy of
the city. The Jesuit Fathers and the Recollects are very
suited to this ministry because they have great
experience in instructing the simple and that it is their
profession.                                                   Signed

                                                    From the orders of the army
