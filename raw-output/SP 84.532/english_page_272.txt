& to make from it a whole whose different parts correspond to each other,
to unite finally; as much as it will be possible, France under the empire
of the same laws, as it is united under the empire of the same
Prince: There, Gentlemen, is the wish of His Majesty, & the occupation that He proposes to your zeal.

Never was work more worthy of your talents, & of the heart
of the King who conceived it; it will eternalize his glory, as his benefactions, & this glorious title that our love has given him, will be
for the most distant posterity, the expression of gratitude
& of piety.
