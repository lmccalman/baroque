My latest Reports from Cartagena
indicate, that the two new
Bomb vessels that Mr. Boutier
is having built, are at full speed,
and will be ready for next
Spring.

It is believed however, that the King
is contemplating another Expedition;
these Conjectures have however
no other foundation, than certain
Preparations that one sees, and among
others, that 7 Regiments of Infantry
remain always both in
Malaga and in the Environs.
