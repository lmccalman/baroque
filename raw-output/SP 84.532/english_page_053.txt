My Lord

To Save your Lordship the
trouble of a Retrospect of the Sums of the
Accounts of the Equipments and
Embarkations of Troops in the fourth
Ports in the Course of the Year 1770
of which I have taken notice as
what has been Publicly been mentioned
in my Publick notes upon these two
Subjects, and before your Lordships in
the outward Trade were so as to be
unexceptionable, I will, at least to
give your Lordship a Proof of the
Confidence with which I honour you with my
Zeal and Attention

I have the honour to be most Respectfully
My Lord

Your Lordships
most humble and
most obedient Servant

P.S. Your smelt from
England on the 8th day
