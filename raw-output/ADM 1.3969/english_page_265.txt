R 29 octo

Paris, October 17, 1782.

There is absolutely nothing
new here. One sees a quantity
of foreigners arriving at Versailles,
including some English. One expects there
[à croye], and the [Comserme] Son of the
King of England.

A Turk has indeed arrived
here; mentioned in my previous,
but one does not know if he brought
Dispatches.

The Reporting Officers and
King's Prosecutor at the Council of
War assembled at L'Orient, knowing
better how to handle the sword than the Pen,
were very embarrassed when they
had to untangle the chaos of
all the Depositions, and put them in
Order; They requested a Clerk
trained in this Work, and the Court has
just sent them a Clerk from the Châtelet.
