                                    Paris, November 8, 1790.

                                    A Courier from London
dispatched by the Count of Guines, arrived
the day before yesterday, has brought, through the Dispatches
some new obstacles
to the Arrangement of Peckenstein;
the King is holding a Council, they have sent
the Courier back to London, and they have
sent another to the Ally Chérisy.

                                    The discussion that the King has just
held on the question of Peace that would be
made to him to accept decides nothing
of which one can

                                    There is nothing relative since

wants to leave.

                                    The Assembly's Decree relative
to the exportation of wheat, gives great
Pleasure in the Ports of Gallines,
because the [Catholettes] marry the
[révient]: [La Mandriette] a great
Number of Workers.
