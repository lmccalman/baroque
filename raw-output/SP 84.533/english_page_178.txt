Madrid the 5th September 1775.

If one speaks of the
News that reign now
in our Quarters, one sees I say
pay more their lights all
full, I found myself in the
same case today, when the
Following News that we had to
receive from Cadiz, were:

The Spanish Warship
the Principe has returned to this
Port in 30 Days of Navigation, from
the Canary Islands, having on Board
a Part of the Regiment of
America, this Ship [n'arti]
Seconded by the Warship the
Dragon, which has on Board the other Part
of said Regiment, thirteen Days
after its Departure from the Islands, but
one expects it successively in
this Bay.
