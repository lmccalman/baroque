We have seen News
by way of Cairo, that on the 9th
of November last, there was a
dangerous Conspiracy in Algiers
against the Life of the Dey, but
that having been discovered in time,
the Guilty had been punished
with the ultimate Punishment.

It appears that our Court
has resolved to no longer send
henceforth Troops
from Europe to America, but
to establish there fixed Regiments,
in the different Provinces,
of People of the Country, with a Staff
of Soldiers and officers from Europe
for Discipline, and
Subordination.
