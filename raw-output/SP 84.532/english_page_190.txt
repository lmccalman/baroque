ment concerted to slander the Magistrature
before the Sovereign, & to succeed, by
dishonoring it, in violating the Laws with impunity,
the preservation of which is one of its most
essential duties.

That the generous firmness, from which these Ma-
gistrates could not deviate without betraying their
conscience & failing in the faith of their oa-
th, has brought them rigorous treatment,
which they would have deserved, if by taking the side
of a blind submission to the mo-
mentary will of said Lord King, they had
preferred it to the Ordinances of the Kingdom, which
are his will always permanent & his
true commandments.

That all the Members of the Parlements are
accused by the Edict, bearing Regulation of the month
of December last, of a crime which
lacks nothing to be punished with all the severity
of the Laws, as capable of disturbing the pu-
blic order, except having taken birth in any other
time & in any other Body: & that it consti-
tutes removing the astorité from the hands of said Lord
King, to leave him only the name & the va-
in shadow of sovereignty.
