The two Frigates of the Commanders finally
of Mr de Keveldo, which have brought to
Cartagena the patache that Brancini
took before Algiers, and mentioned
in one of my previous ones, have
come to position themselves in the said
Squadron.

The Rumor also runs, that the Departure
of the small Navy of Naples,
with landing troops,
must also join us.

The Regiment of Castille, in
Garrison at Valencia, and that
of Hibernian Irish, which were
at Pamplona, as well as that of
Guadalajara, which was in full
March to go in Garrison
to Barcelona, all three of Infantry,
are currently on the March
for Extremadura, as well
as the Cavalry Regiment of
St Hugh, and that of Dragoons
of Sagunto.
