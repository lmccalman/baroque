This small Vessel coming from Morea
has reported that A Russian Squadron having
arrived, disembarked its People in
Morea, and that all at once the entire Country
had submitted itself to the Empress of Russia
and had Shaken off the Yoke of the Turks,
that several Pashas and other Officers
had been slaughtered. This News
may have some truth, because there are
in Morea Six Christians for one
Turk, but the Russians are so accustomed
to exaggerating their Advantages, that one must
await more Certain Details.
