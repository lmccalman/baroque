The Chatelet, which was nothing, because
they were Justices of the Peace, to
give soul to that which it not
as Parliament, made born presented
our my Inquests and Petitions 2:.
There is rather the History of the Sieur
and of the Council.

The current state of Things requiring
prompt change, the Council
will tempt the Parliament, will disturb it
his Majesty with M. d'Orleans will wait

the Good Will to the Parvenus
and Governors.

in no way the Cause of the Exiles;
they are only offended that the Court

that it will diminish.

Then of the Balloon, the Lantern approaches;
and it is claimed that it will be in 14;
that the Chasses upon his return to the
Palace moreover, has seen again Father Gotthori of
of his Madere.

On.
