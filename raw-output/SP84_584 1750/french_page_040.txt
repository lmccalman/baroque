Vienna and Munich have taken, will make it
unnecessary for me to write to His Majesty's
Ministers at those Courts, till I have Your
Graces further orders.

The same Merchant that gave me last Post
the Declaration about the Prussian Ship the
Old bean, has promised to write this day to
Bourdeaux, from whence he hopes to have an
information of a case still more glaring.

I have the honour to be most respectfully


My Lord Duke

Your Graces

most humble & most
obedient Servant
R.M. Creven.
