to have the two sums which were paid by the two
relatives; in this case one could observe that the price of the
annuity was superior to that which it would have had if it
had been established at the time of receiving the two sums, and
one could believe that those who made these advances had
the intention of gaining the difference and of committing a manifest
usury; but one shows that there is no usury
because they stipulate nothing beyond the legitimate annuity
which they could have demanded at the time of receiving the two
sums; whereas if they had stipulated more they
would have committed a usury; thus one must judge in the same way
the other cases where it is a question of knowing if one can receive
a higher price for an annuity than that which one would have
had at the time of receiving the money which served to establish it
one must examine if this surplus of price comes from the fact that
he who gives it wishes to procure for himself presently an
annuity stronger than that which he would have had if he had
bought it at the time of receiving the money and if the augmentation
of the price is not a means which one uses to cover
a usury; or rather if the surplus of the price comes simply
from the fact that the annuity has become more expensive since the time
that one received the money until that when one buys it: for
in the first case there would be usury, and in the second
there would be none.
