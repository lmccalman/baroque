Act—

I have according to Lord Chesterfield's orders
rejoin'd my application to the Magistrate of this Town
with relation to intercepting dull letters as we have
reason to suppose; but I have received nothing from
the Post office to day, which I am attribute to nothing
but the Clerk of the Post office being still ill so as not to
be able to attend.

that my request would be granted, shew'd many
difficulties as to the execution of the thing which
would much more of the business than the
Request; which I think however than I have all
answer'd, I shall see him again to morrow and in-

granted so as to begin next tuesday, I will by memorial
address myself to the Prince of Orange, from whom I
may then have speedy recommendation.—

                                                                        person
