nothing is so too easy, but the Pope has
sent one of his Gentlemen to
have News of the woman in childbed.

She is doing very well; but to
hide from this Princess the Death of her
Child, they have made the exchange for her
substituted another, born the same day
in the Palace, and this Child dressed
in the superb Layette which was prepared
has been shown to her, she has welcomed him with
caresses, [l'a appris], [si] has been told to her, that they
were going to have him taken to St Cloud,
to nurse him in good air; they will not
inform her of this deception, until
she is well recovered from her Childbed.
Many people regard this action
as too cunning a Policy,
especially with regard to the [Pouvain] Prince of the Blood.

It is beyond disputing
the Inheritance of another, who has seen the
true one, as well as the one who was substituted.

It is claimed here, that Sr Chaperon
whom the Pope has sent back with in petto
is destined for the Archbishopric of Paris,
granted at the Entreaties of Madame
Laguisse.
