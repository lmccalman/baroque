Rotterdam this 3rd September
1778.

Sir,

I have indeed received today
my ordinary Packet from Paris,
but the correspondent has
forgotten, or neglected to put
the Dispatch in it. Which I regard
as an accident that can
happen. But what intrigues me,
is that I have received nothing from
your correspondent, that is to
say that the Paris sheets are
absolutely missing today.
I shall wait until next tomorrow,
to see what it will produce,
and I shall have accordingly.

I have the honor to be
Sir,

Your very humble and
very Obedient Servant
M. Wolton
