R.18.  N.12.


                    Paris January 2, 1776.

                        The Letters from our Ports
speak only of Holland where they are taking
new Armaments and a
Promotion in the Navy.
    It is still assured at Toulon,
that there will be a great Armament
this Spring, and what confirms it
is the quantity of Biscuits that are
being manufactured in the Magazines.
    M. de St. Germain still
makes the object of conversations,
some disapprove of him, others
approve of him, and others
cannot understand him.
    It was believed to see on the Project
to form an Infantry.
    Thus while the details do not
resume the attentions of the Court
it is claimed that the spirit does not
modify them [vres] much.   These
                                    Minister.
