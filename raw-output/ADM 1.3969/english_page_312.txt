18 [reluis] N°4.

Madrid the 6th February 1784.

One reports from Cadiz
on the 22nd of the Current [month], that a Dutch
Squadron, destined for the
Mediterranean, has greatly Suffered
from a Storm on our Coasts,
that one of the Vessels, commanded by
Captain de Rechteren, Brother
of the Ambassador of Holland
here, had entered the Bay
almost entirely dismasted,
one thinks that the rest will have
reached Malaga.

It appears that the Damage
occasioned by the Overflow
of the Guadalquivir at Seville
Amounts to several Millions
