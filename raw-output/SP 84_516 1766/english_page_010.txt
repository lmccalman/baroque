Rumors that are being spread, in order to
intimidate us, they will be able to renew them
in St Pierre itself; but let us not
be Surprised by the Traps
that will be set for us, and let us have
only our Duty before our Eyes,
and our Oath as Citizens in
our hearts.

If, as we dare to flatter ourselves,
the Success of the Batch responds
to your Expectation, let no indiscreet
Exclamation escape us, let us withdraw
quietly and in Silence.
This Mark of Moderation will
do us as much Honor, as
a Reproach that we do not deserve,
has been able to indignify us.
