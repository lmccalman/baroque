B urbroy N°87

Paris the 21 December 1784.

There is much talk today
of a Congress to settle the
existing disputes between the Emperor
and the Dutch; at Venice, Upsal
enters into war. This would be at least
the wishes of France, of Prussia,
and of the Peers of Holland to make
the Emperor consent to restore by
the opening of the Scheldt, he would give to the
Dutch the valley of Commencé
could a reconciliation take
place? War therefore remains
probable.

We learn that a rich Foreign
Merchant, has presented to the Emperor a
Plan, for the establishment of an extensive Commerce
in the Ports of the Levant, with
the office of establishing in one of the Ports,
of the Coast, and to contribute all
his fortune to this establishment.
