the Royal Provostships being suppressed, it should not
be omitted from the 2nd and from the enlightenment of the
Magistrates who comprised it, and their
office of Procurators in other Bodies, without
leaving any under their [normes], and the
Shops then surveyed.

The charges of the Members of the Court of
Aids are legalized, is the edict, in the
March, and the Lease of royal farms has been exercised
in Paris without existence, up to the name
of [amesserement].

The King instructed that these [chefferies] would not
please him as equally the [appraissée].
thus the [Arrend] of Billaux, the Administration of
woods and forests is entrusted to different
intendants, [Plaines], and Prohibitions to them alone
enforceable of the Police. There in entirety
are things.

Based on this hypothesis, the
greater part of the Members of the Court of
Aids, have retired to their Paris, and
the body is currently forming the
Presents, and to the King's Orders to break it
Tomorrow as Body of Court at Versailles;
the troops rendering them the same
honors that were rendered to the Parliaments
in similar circumstances.

From this fact to be silent being freed,
one adds to it what precedes two others
of the Circle, a celebrated army, in September
of May and Woman, the next day one had
bound there.
