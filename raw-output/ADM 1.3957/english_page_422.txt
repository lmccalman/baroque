of this City 300 Pieces of Cannons of
different Caliber, several Mortars,
Cannonballs and other Munitions of War,
to be transported to the different
Ports of Spain, as well as to Ceuta.

Bourbon left on the route from
Barcelona to Cadiz.

They are embarking the [Evangile] of Murcia
and they are marching with the 1st and the two of
Soria [Milicellannes] to accompany
this last Place, Ceuta.

I am written to from Cadiz of the 18th current,
that the Hope which had been dispatched for
the [Cours] at the [Aronde] of the Trinidad St.
Catherine, had returned on the 16th of this
Month, and that it was supposed that it would have been
[parpé] on Board to deliver to the Captain
a [Bageot]; and that no other Person had come
on board except Mr. Madavinaga,
and
