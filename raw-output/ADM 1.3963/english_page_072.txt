                           Second

                    Madrid the 29 April 1776.

                    Lieutenant General
Marquis de Devalles, Governor
of this Capital, who was
at the Company of Walloon Halberdiers,
was summoned to Court at Aranjuez,
to report there to the Officers [mex]
of General Officers, who are
there, and the Count d'Argende,
that the Count de Kelly, Mr. de Wallen
and Mr. d'Altemburgo in Madrid, that the
news that was received from the
Frontier are so Good, that one
would say that there were Portuguese, is without
foundation; for being always
Men of the King, it is much more
truly seeming, that the command
still of the Army in the order of Neptune.
