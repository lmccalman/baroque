the Elector Palatine, not without Skeyne of
being seconded in their Endeavours by
several other Powers. It is however feared
with some of our Magistrates, if their
having consented to the former Resolution
upon this Affair, will not be pleaded
as binding them to its Consequences.

The vocal Benefit which I have received
from being in the Country last Summer,
and the very indifferent State of my Health,
oblige me to renew my humble Request
to your Lordship for leave of Absence
for next Summer, at least, for such Part
of it as may be necessary for my Health.

If the Affairs which I have the Honour
to be entrusted with, could but in the least
suffer from my Absence, I would not
presume to make this Request to your
Lordship; but besides my leaving my
Business in very good Hands, I am at
Cuut Bentink's House near Leyden.
