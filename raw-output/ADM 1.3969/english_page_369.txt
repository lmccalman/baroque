17 1 Juby

Paris the 18th June 1788,

     Nothing very interesting is
happening at this moment, either at
Court or in the City, people are still
occupied with the stay that the King
of Sweden is making with us.

     One sees by the Letter that the Minister
of the Navy wrote to Mr. de Graffe,
that the King is displeased with this
general, for the wrongs he imputed
to the Officers of the Navy, who find
themselves cleared of accusation.
His Majesty forbids Mr. de Graffe to
appear before him, and the Minister
advises him to go to his Province.

     It is claimed that there is a dispute
that has arisen between Prussia and Russia,
it is even said that the Minister of the King
of Prussia in Petersburg is about to
depart for Berlin.
