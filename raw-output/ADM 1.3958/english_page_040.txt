                        Paris the 28th January 1773.

                        The news

of the Day, and which occupies all Minds, is the
entire Destruction of the Parlement.

One did not expect this Act
of Vigor from the King, who is good,
and who does not like to make anyone perish.

Fifty Four Members who had
signed everything, showed themselves inflexible,
Twelve, are names which surprise that they
showed themselves so firm. They were
banished in the evening in the hands of all the
Company, these Gentlemen received
the amendment in fraternal guard
like the others; the Chancellor wished
to provide for everything, the [Loyers de Cachot]
which they rented, and the Friends of the Council
who relinquish their Charges, were
prepared and signed, one had only the
Date to put there.

I am inclined to believe that this Chief of
Justice has pushed too far what he has done
here; for it would be better to hear
Parlements after having done as much as
that of Paris, and that they be blessed
in the same way.
