Rotterdam 5th January 1778.

My Lord

                    After all that I am writing,
the french Mail is not yet arrived, and if
not in at one O'clock P.M. I think, it
will be too late for this Day's Packett, as
they are not delivered after that Hour.

The Spanish Letter, which I should
have had on tuesday, by a Mistake
of the Boy, was not delivered till Yesterday
Morning, having for One, delivered me
the Wedsnoday.

The Letters particularly as coming by
a day time, I only receive on Wedsnodays
and saturdays.

If Mr de la Balaye has been dismissed
from his Post, I fear it would have been
dangerous for the Montaudoins, who
but at this time most of the Directors,
are now out.

I have the Honor to be most Respectfully,

P.S. Mr A. Departure of the Paris                    My Lord
french Mail is not arrived.                        Your Lordships
                                                    most humble and
                                                    most Obedient Servant,
                                                    R.W.Hn.
To His Excelly The Earl of Sandwich.
