Private Letter

Paris, May 21, 1778.

The Count de Barry
Brother-in-law of the Countess of the same Name, residing
almost always in Paris, and being from time
rarely at Court, has although he [ées] young
people at his orders, who go ordinarily
continually, and carry Ministerial
dispatches, told us this morning with tears
in his eyes, that the Countess de Barry informed him
that it was necessary to have much Wit and
much Credit for that of the Countess,
and who does not leave it at all, and it was never [entre
tête] among the three Persons, that sometimes what
Madame de Barry should do or say, and has
presented that one of the Bastards of the Countess
by an Intrigue with the brother of the Counts
de Barry, came continually to the
Extremities of the Kingdom, and would finish the voyage
in foreign places, without anyone knowing
the Object of all these Movements. Now taking
only, that Mr. de Barry, who has always
affected to attach himself to the Library and to that of
the Institute of [Bénués], finished this morning
to leave himself, apparently these Foreigners,
for the vacant Ministry, without other cause
to Hope.
