Madrid the 4th January 1775.

You have, perhaps, had
knowledge, by a Courier of Prince Massarano
come from Brussels, that the Dispatches between
the Courts of London and Madrid were
concluded amicably and to the Satisfaction
of the two Courts, there also still remains for me
one of the Couriers, of which I do not know,
not even where you are, nor if he will arrive near
you.

This same Courier said, that an order had been
sent to Monsieur Stormont,
to turn back on his Steps, and to
proceed here.

[En l'embetant] it is in the same
Position until you see marked in
my previous ones

They write to me from Cadix, that there are
now at present 10. Ships
of the Line armed, and that they were expecting there
10. War Ships from Ferrol.
