Bastia the 4th April 1793.

                                The Bandits
are beginning once again to have activities, they have
attacked the different posts of the Regiment
of the Regiment of Alsace, which was in
Corsica. I had employed this Regiment
in the County of Cansone, which is partly in
France, there were some men
killed on both sides. The Count of
Malespry marched with the Battalion
against the Bandits, all the
villages of Malespry have been invested and the Bandits who are
in flight. The General and the Bandits
arms have been returned to the Corsicans and who
had been granted the Carrying. Everything
seems to announce a general
Expedition [ces].
