Madrid the 15th September 1782.

Just recently the King received
by the Express from Cadiz the agreeable
News of the arrival of the second Convoy
from Havana; with Don B. de Galvez,
Lieutenant-General, and the Troops under
his Orders, but in a pitiful State;
having lost more than Half since
their Departure from Europe through Diseases.
It appears that very little Silver
comes by this Convoy, which the Commerce
of Cadiz feels infinitely, all the
more so, that one does here France during
the Course of the War has totally
flooded all America with
Merchandise of all kinds, that they
are there at a better price than in
Europe; and that consequently one
must not think of Barter without
sending it some from our Continent.
