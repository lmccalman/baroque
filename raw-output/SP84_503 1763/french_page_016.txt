Sir

It is with the
greatest Satisfaction, that
I acquaint You with the
good News of the safe
Delivery of the Queen, who
was happily brought to
bed of a Second Prince this
Morning about ten o'clock;
and that both Her Majesty
and the young Prince are,
God be praised, as well as
can be expected. This
fortunate of His Royal
Family cannot fail to
give me great Pleasure to
all His Majesty's Faithful
Subjects, and I almost
heartily congratulate you
upon the joyful Occasion

I am &c
Your &c
Dunk Halifax
