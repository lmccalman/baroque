Letter from the Correspondents
of the Laughing Committees.

                                Paris, March 22, 1793.

                                        The affairs of the
Piedmonts is not yet finished, I expect tomorrow
that it will hold some [différables]. The Committees are
composed of their own affairs. Now
of the King who the Politics, have ordered
to go in this the Bearing of some Princes of the
Blood.

In the last Assembly it was resolved
to send a grand Post very dear to the Royal,
defend obediently to the King, so that he may
put all things back in a peaceful State,
and that for the Peoples, one would have a Means
to make a prompt Convocation of the
Estates General.

One of the principal of Commissioner of the Police,
with whom I had an Interview, wishes well
to inform me, that the Lieutenant General
of Police had recently received several
anonymous Notes, by one of which one
threatened, that if the King did not reestablish for
the Parliament of Paris, there will be in the
very Streets of Paris, or that the Police would have arrested
again certain People, there would be. etc etc
