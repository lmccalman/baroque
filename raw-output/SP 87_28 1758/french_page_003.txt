arrived at Rotterdam the preceeding night
being the 1st instant to concert measures
privately with him. to provide a sufficient
number of Dutch boats.
    This evening I have had the honor
to pay my Duty to the Royal Highness
The Prince of Orange, The French
Stattholder and Prince Caroline, I have
also to day paid my respects to Prince
Lewis of Brunswick and dined with him
a little before dinner the took me into
his closet, and told me he was then
concerting measures in the most secret
manner about providing Dutch boats
and hoped his endeavours would succeed
to the satisfaction of Prince Ferdinand
of Brunswick, and that he believed his
brother would be extremely glad if he
could also have the Pontoons, as they
might be of great service upon several
occasions, and that he thought they
would be made in England sooner and
