Colonies only as they have Connections with
but will use every trick to give the Genl
a bad opinion of the Settlements named by
the Government. This has certainly been
the Case with regard to Georgia and Nova
Scotia. The Merchants saying that it
would draw off a Number of People from
them, have used all imaginable tricks
to dissuade the People from going thither
by false Representations of the Country
of the Soil, and of the Manner of using
them there.
