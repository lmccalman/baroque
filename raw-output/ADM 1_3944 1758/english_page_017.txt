A French Courier passed
here, yesterday, going to Paris with the News that
there was an Action the 30th of last Month between
a Corps of the Army of Marshal de Contades
and a Corps of the Austrian Army near
Lipstadt, in which the Hanoverians and the
Allies had to retire after having lost about
600 Men killed on the Field of Battle; that
many Prisoners were taken from them, and that
a great Number of Tents and Baggage were taken from them.
There are Letters which say that the [Galenra] &
Ferrier after having gathered the Troops, had
set out on the March to attack the Count of Brühl
Wied, as he was retreating to regain
Warburg the Swedes approached Berlin
and that to hold them back all
the Bridges had been broken.
