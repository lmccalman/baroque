have thrown up -
I have the honor to be most respectfully

my Lord Duke

your grace's
most humble & most
obedient Servant

Robert Young 13, 1848

P.S. Just before I sealed this I received a letter from
Ben niger which tells me that by great exertions
of the Companies had already named their officers
that the men would follow, and that it was hoped
that the full repair would be made to the Police
& through this morning for his approbation, after
which I suppose that the Prince will learn & mind
the people seemed resolved to be invariably better
humored than they have been for several days past
