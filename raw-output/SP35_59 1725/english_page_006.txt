I hold myself to the Treaties of Alliance which have been
made and to pursue the measures which have been taken
for the Good of the common Cause and one promises oneself
much here of the good intentions and the ability
of this Lord. I shall not fail Sir to
maintain a constant correspondence with His Excellency
and to conform myself to the orders which He finds good
to send me, as you have commanded me to do
on behalf of His Majesty.

I took the honor of indicating to you Sir in
my preceding letter, that His Britannic Majesty
was cantoning his Armies with those of the House
of Orange in quality of heir (as she claims)
of the late King our Master and that She had already
had possession taken of the County of Namur and of
Longny. I have also learned since that Mr Condely
who is in Switzerland on behalf of this Prince must have
made his diligences with regard to the Principality
of Orange, the County of Neufchatel. For which
our late glorious Monarch had claims,
and [Terres seintes] in the County of Burgundy.
