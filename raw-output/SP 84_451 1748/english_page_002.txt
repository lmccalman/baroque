for having been assassinated by the servants, the people gathered, & demanded
justice with violence, they searched for the guilty parties, they took several who
were put to torture & executed, the others took flight, & withdrew
into the mountains, where they have become highway robbers.
These disorders have cast alarm among the inhabitants of the country, who fear
that the King will oblige them to pay the debts of this Prince, which would put them
in great misery. It is said that the Count of Brienne Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs, who was sent on behalf of the King to make
the inventory of the furniture & effects of the Duke of Lorraine, has found much
confusion in his affairs, & that his debts amount to more than two
million. It is added that the King has ordered the Parliament of Metz to
take cognizance of this affair, & to judge the servants who
have committed these assassinations. It is reported from Nancy that the King has had
Mr. de Choiseul set at liberty who had been arrested, because they
could not find any proof against him, & that His Majesty has given
order that all the servants of the late Duke who were in prison, be
released, except those who would be found guilty of the assassinations
that have been committed. The King has also ordered that an exact
inquiry be made into all that has happened, in order to punish the authors, & to render
justice to those who might have been accused unjustly.
