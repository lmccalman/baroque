They report from Ferrol, that the mysterious
Frigate the St. Catalina had arrived there
from S. Caimans. It is added, that they had
raised a Wall and an immense Height,
in order to prevent one from
being able to see what is happening in
the Shipyard of this Town; and that it
is constructed in such a way to be able to
place a Battery there if one considered it good.

I was informed from Barcelona, that
they had there in 1757 lastly 78
[Pisas] and [de la mode Hontes], made on the
new French Model

The Russian Fleet composed of 20 Sails
of which the largest have for 50 s, has passed
the Strait of S.G. [du Courzols].
