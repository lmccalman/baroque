I hope you will give me now an answer of
mine to you Doctor of Loing Concerning Rotterdam,
and that you are satisfied of the same of the
impossibility of my being anyway concern'd in the
Licence charged upon at present. I am sure I durst
not therefore can hardly wish to hear that Charitable
Man cut as mine is;
    It being Conscious to my Self of my innocence
& yet much greater Room to doubt my assistance in
this my doubtfull Condition, which afflicts me at
Home to yet Last degree, and in world I call Reception
is here any of Left at all, as an Stranger can inform
you; therefore I most humbly beg of your approbation
    of my Complaint of their Cruelness &
words & Malice and of my own of most Submissive
humble beg their Tender & Compassion on misery
& as I Shall ever Father to owe my first means
& Duty for this Glory of Set at Liberty to morrow
as God take pencilwise where you doubtless will have
their Informations to deliver me of it: Camp me of
    Complying with another, and to find the
immoveable worth in me to do Justice to the
long labours of these Charitable men that know my
grounds of Charity, with be graciously pleased to indulge
me So far as to Send forth to of Same person that thing
