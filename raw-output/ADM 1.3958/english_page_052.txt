         Toulon, January 25, 1773.

                We are still waiting for
favorable Winds for the Departure of
our two Frigates la Blanche and la Kosaize;
they come fortunately to R.t since
some Orders have arrived, their Instructions
are such as are given in full Peace.

    Work is being vigorously renewed to put
the Batteries of the Forts and of the Harbor in
a state of defense. The new Inspector General
of the Arsenal, we have M. Chevalier in
[en chef d'Ettre armés]; do we have enough
Sailors? no one believes it;
[il n'y faut batte] the arrival of [Beaux]
last Year.

    We have no present
Movements, except our two Frigates.

    They have sent to Place at the [instance]
of Pierre Longue, with 30 transport
Vessels, loaded with troops.
[Les fours ont si plein à s'avoir tous
le grand Males et dans les trannes].

    The [Prateurs] of Portugal have burned
a Spanish Vessel, and threaten
Spain with another, near
[Islys].
