better than they could possibly be made
here, and desired I would acquaint your
Lordship with what he/she had said to me.

To morrow I shall proceed on my
journey with all the expedition I can
possibly make, being very impatient to
be at Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick's
Head Quarters.

Prince Lewis has given me a Note
which the something about is the Finale.
He advises me to take, and has cautioned
me not to travelle in the night. He further
told me that hearing I was coming, He
had already writ to Prince Ferdinand to
Recommend me to Him in the strongest
manner. He inquired much after your
Lordship and Lord Ligonier and desired
his Compliments to You.

I have the honour to be with
the greatest Respect
my Lord your Lordships
most humble and most
Obedient Servt
