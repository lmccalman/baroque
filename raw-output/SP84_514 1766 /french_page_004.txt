Rotterdam the 22d July 1768.

Sir

I take the Liberty to Send you enclosed the Account of the Spanish Commanders Draft upon Laurens van Mierop & Soonen, amounting to £40. 10s. 9d. Sterling for the Half of Christins Bills of £81. 1s. 6d. Sterling I have by the next Post take the Liberty to draw upon William Davis Esqr of the Treasury, at 20 Days Date.

The Third Cover you send is now begun to be full of Copies that the Letter lately intercepted will bring on no bad Consequence either to himself or to his friend at Canton, who hints to him that he will continue to replace the next half fild List of the french Plays, which was sent in the said Paquet, as also the present he is obliged to make to great Pecuniarys in his Correspondence.

I have the Honour to be most Respectfully
                                        Sir
                            your most Obedient
                            most Obedient Servant
                                        R. Wolters.
