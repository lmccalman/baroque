his Marshal de la Combes for the Marquis de
Bouillé. News from Marshal de Broglie
for the Count of Rochambeau.
There is no longer any doubt that the Count des
Meillebois will yield to the Desires
of the States-General, who have requested
him to command their troops;
he has no remaining
objection today, since the Dutch
are not, as was feared
at first in retaking it, abandoned
to their own forces. We have seen
arrive here M. de Villeuvois,
First Inspector of the Artillery,
although he must remain in the Territories
until Norll. Of all the leaders
designated by the [Pollitt], Marshal
de Broglie is the only one who is
not yet here.

The Signing of the Edict for the Loan
which was to take place today,
has been postponed to another Day.
