Rotterdam 25th December 1773

Sir

By this days Mail from France
I have received the annexed Packet from
our Chief Paris Correspondent, and
as he doth not mention any other thing than
his not hearing from me by the preceding
post, I must conclude, that that days
Packets has miscarryed; altho' this is a
very disagreeable and even alarming
Circumstance, and but too frequently the
I may say fate of it; yet because of it,
I apprehend forbid to make a low
Stock hereof after it. I shall mention
the Misgoing of it to our Correspondent,
and ask his opinion about it, and that
is all I think I ought to do for the
present in this Affair.

Speemens offering you my best wishes
Wishes for the approaching blessed
opportunities of this New Year; and have the
Honour to be with due Respect

Sir

your most humble and
most obedient Servant
J.G. Hake

Hon. Fraser Esq'r
