Portugal has seen it dispatched to the [four clia
pitalante]; The [Corrompes] for
[s'attant]. The [toit d'amortique] to [Se
autranche], has only [asparés].
    The Levies by Provinces, are
raised throughout the Kingdom, & amount
to 16 Thousand Men.
It is counted that the levies will
produce from 10 to 12 Thousand,
to complete the Army.
    To the Audience of Cedus, of the
Marquis of Casa de Rilly, it is necessary
to add another [Olayfani] of the
King, of 90 Cannons, named the
St. Damaso. The two new Bomb vessels
arrive from Cartagena,
to join the said Squadron and
are the St. Capella, and the St. Eulalia.
But, the Vessels at [figuanda]
appear to draw too much Water for
the River of Plata. They leave
the Design to the better knowledge
of the Mariners.
