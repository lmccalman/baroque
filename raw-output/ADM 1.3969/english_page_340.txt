By 27 March 1704.

Paris the 15th March 1784.

New [information] has come to me
from our Sea Ports, they do not cease
to give Details of the Misfortunes
that were suffered in the Months of
December, and last January.

Nothing at all interesting
either at Court or in the City.

P.S. The Frigate the Cleopatra, has
just arrived at Brest, she had departed
in convoy with Mr. de St. Priest from
the Isle de France.
