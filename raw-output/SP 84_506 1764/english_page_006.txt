I am very pleased to have given you this
satisfaction and I am very sorry that the
death of M. Dubois prevented me from
contributing to that of his children with all
the attention that I intended to bring to it.
I am very sensitive to your courtesies and I
pray you to be persuaded that I will respond
to them with pleasure in all occasions that
will present themselves. I have the honor to be with
a very sincere attachment

Sir

Your very humble and very
obedient servant
