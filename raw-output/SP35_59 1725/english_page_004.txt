Sir

[Faded paragraph - largely illegible]


I only had time last Saturday to acknowledge
the receipt of the Letters which you did me
the honor of writing to me on the 10th and the 13th of March
past because I only received them at the moment of the
departure of the Post. It is with very great
satisfaction that one learns here that things are going so
well in England. You will soon know more
about it in this country. You The honor the day before yesterday
to put my letter after having put myself in mourning in the manner
that you ordered me to, to present to the King


to Mr. Secretary of State Vernon
