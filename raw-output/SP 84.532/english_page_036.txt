N° 3.

                                          Paris the 4th January 1775.

        Our Letters of departure
and of department are of the 30th Decr. and of the
3rd of the Current month, with the Dispatches of the
two Ministers.

        Word is sent from L'orient on the 29th that Sieur
Veissieux le Bignon, and the Count de Verdun had
arrived from the Coromandel Coast by
contrary winds; they are expected
at Brest.

        A Letter from Havre of 3rd January
reports, that Sr. Beutelec, was there
in part, that the Enfants and the 13 [Entoura]
accompanied by two other large Merchant
Ships, and that they were to set
Sail the next day.

        The Beginning of these two Letters
appeared to us so interesting that we believed
prudent, that the Heights of Cape [2gacus],
and the other Information, which to them
offered their true Destination.

        What occupies all Paris today
is the Expectation in which one is for news
from the Coast the [Rag-non] has not yet
declared.

        The Chevalier de Muy had the agreeable
private Conference with His Majesty
this morning at eight o'clock with Report
the War.
