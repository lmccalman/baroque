We received yesterday Letters from
Constantinople of the 20th January. The Turks
had a Fleet of 25 Ships,
Without those expected from Alexandria
and the Barbary Coasts; They had
400 Thousand Men of Land Troops.
It is a Rumor that was very dormant, and which
is awakening.

One fears here the general War for
the next Campaign.

The famous Crisis of Bristy, which has
always put Obstacles to the Commerce
of Vessels for the Provisioning
of Paris, has just been suppressed; which
gives great Pleasure to the Bakers;
and one hopes that the [Venalers] will be less
expensive than heretofore.
