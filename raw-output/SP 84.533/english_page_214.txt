Madrid the 26th September 1775.

They write to me from Ferrol,
that the Warship the St Joseph,
of America of 80. Pieces of Canon, has
received the order to depart with speed
for Cadiz, where it is assigned to guard
of this residence of Forces.

The Expenses of Cadix report, that the
Warship the St Julien of 80.
and the Oristeur of 64. and 60. Traps
of the same Calibers, are going to be put in
to convoy the Vessels which must depart
for the Indies, and that [la Dengui] who
will have the Command as
Admiral.

It has been learned that there are Letters,
from Vera Cruz of the 4th June, which say,
that the Warship the Castilles
of 80. Cannons, and the Frigate the Saint
Rosalie, of 80. Cannons, were to
depart from there the three following
for Spain with Register
of Silver.
