to have seriously [sérieu le] a Vessel, and two
brigantines, bearing Matthews Colors;
9 [lieu] Vessel Canon Cavalli forced
to strike, and which being within Range of
this small Squadron hoisted white
Colors. The Commander
questioned the French Captain
on the Prize War affair, whether
there were in this Sea any
French, Spanish, English,
or Russian Vessels. Whether in
France, it was believed that there would

one perceived, of what Nation
are these three Vessels, and their
Plans, one would believe by these
Waters. The general Opinion is,
that they are English, in Alliance
with the English.
