Vienna the 25th April 1776.

                    Last Sunday
in the morning, the Emperor arrived here on
the return from the Camp near Prüll; and
Tuesday at 10 O'clock in the Evening, His Majesty
departed from here for that one near
Prague, from where He will go to the one
near Olmutz in Moravia, and will
not return here, until around the End
of September.

     From what is learned, the Emperor
was very displeased with the Maneuvers
of the troops in Hungary; that is why
some Regiments, and among others
that of Archduke Ferdinand,
and that of Beczfark, both of them
Infantry Regiments,
                must remain yet
some Weeks at the Camp, to
do Exercises there, and Duke Albert of
Saxe-Teschen, will remain, to have
the Inspection of it.
