Charles V in the year 1529, which suffered
so many contradictions, was completed
from Tudela in Navarre, to
Zaragoza, the distance of 32 leagues determined
as much to irrigate the lands, as for
navigation, on the 14th where passed six
barges loaded with 2400 quintals,
having arrived at Zaragoza, to the great
astonishment of all its inhabitants.
One adds, that shortly navigation
will be opened by the Ebro to
the sea, through the beautiful port of Los
Alfaques de Tortosa.
