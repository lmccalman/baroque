Madrid the 29th November 1710.

Since my last
have arrived here 1200 Militiamen to
complete the Regiments of Navarre
and Gallice, which supplied them in
this City; and there is an order to increase
the Battalion of Volunteers of Aragon
composed of 400 Men up to 600.

We are told from Cadiz, that the Regiment
of Ireland, which was in that
City, received Order by the last
Courier from the Court, to extend ready to
embark for America, they say
for Porto-Rico; the said Regiment must
be increased by 400 to 500 Men
from the Regiment of Borbonès.

The Orders from Barcelo must contain
to Convoke at Cettez the Regiments
of Africa, which, it is claimed,
will also pass to America.

At S. Ilazar de Barnameda have arrived
2 Regiments of Cavalry, 2 others at
Cette de Lyon, and 3 at Mataro, and in their
of others must arrive — others at
Chelona.
