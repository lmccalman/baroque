Castries the 5th March 1775.

On the 11th of last month there arrived
from Havana in this Bay a Spanish Bark
named the Conception, from which we
have received sent to Madrid to
announce to us that the President of the Contratation
hastened towards the Champ: It is reported
for this Vessel, that the first Battalions
of the Regiments of Navarre, carried two Days
from America on the 8th November last, had
arrived at Destination after a short
and fortunate Navigation.

Since that time there have arrived here some
other Spanish Vessels, returning from
Havana with Cargoes of Sugar,
of Tobacco, Hides, [Bautés], and other Goods,
making exit from a Convoy of 32 sails of
Ships, and among others the St. Madeleine,
which had put in while coming from Cartagena
of the Indies, to Havana; where they had
disembarked 800 thousand Piastres, on Account
of the Funds of France.

The bearer of this Bark on the 21st of the present
was not of Measures, of which it is believed that the
Destination is for Us [ne l'y].
