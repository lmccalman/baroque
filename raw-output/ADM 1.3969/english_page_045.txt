         The Court has just received
at last News from M. de Suffren,
by a Ship that came from India,
and which stopped very little Time at
the Cape of Good Hope. We have
learned from these Dispatches that the Battle
between the Two Fleets took place on the 6th
of September, it was very intense, and it would have been
decisive in our favor, if a Division
had done its Duty, like the Rest of
the Squadron. M. de Suffren by a
skillful maneuver, entered Anguemale
before Admiral Hughes, he descended
himself to Land, to be Witness
of the Attack on the principal Fort.
The Enemies defended it with
nearly Four Hundred Men, they
did not wait for the Assault to be given,
and M. Hughes received their Capitulation,

                                                           that
