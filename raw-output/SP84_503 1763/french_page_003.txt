Sir,

     The King approving
Your Proposals of settling an foot
a Correspondence by which
We may have from time to time
Accounts of what passes in the
Ports of Spain with regard to
the Marine Force of that
Kingdom as You represent it
to be necessary that a Sum of
£150. should be remitted as
soon as possible to Madrid
in order to give a beginning
to & settle such a Correspondence,
whereas the annual Expence
is to be afterwards fixed, I
have now His Majesty's
Orders to acquaint You that
He is pleased to consent to your
making that advance, for
which You are to draw upon
Mr Davis at the Treasury as
You have usually done for
other Disbursements of the
like kind.

I am &c.        J. Halifax
