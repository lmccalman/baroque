A Witticism is cited from Abbé Ferraz
the Day when he received the Compliments for
his new Ministry; I do not know
why, he said, all these Compliments,
I am not at all the Minister of the Navy,
but a Sea Skimmer    Which
confirms the Conjectures that he only remains
in this Position to examine
the Expenses of this Department, delve
into all the Details, reform them,
reduce them as much as will be possible;
cut off the superfluous Expenses in
Pensions, Gratifications &c, and put
his Successor in no position to
increase them without Knowledge of
the Cause    .
