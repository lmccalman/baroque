Paris the 4th June 1784.

There is nothing new
from our Ports.

We know nothing yet
certain about the Fate of Mr de Grasse;
it is claimed that the Decision of the Council
of War of the Orient, is against Him.

It is assured that everything is arranged
in Rome, between the Ambassadors of the
House of Bourbon, and that of Russia.
Mr de Noailles seeks to obtain from this
same From prince de Kaunitz, the disavowal
that he owed him, and by which he
[Justitoit] to regard as senseless,
a writing that the [reverends] of the
Sovereigns of Russia explained
the [Sarment] in our favor, the violent
part to Mr de Noailles to take at this
moment the rights of the house of Bourbon,
the Ambassador of Spain being his associate.
