Return with the most lively Impatience,
because the Dispatches will say, will declare
either Peace, or War. But
whether we have War, or Peace,
the Imperial Troops will continue
their March toward the Low Countries,
because His Imperial Majesty
wants to always maintain in these
Provinces an Army of 40 Thousand
Men.
