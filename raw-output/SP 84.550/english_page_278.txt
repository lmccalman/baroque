Paris, June 3, 1778

Our Letters from B...
have announced nothing more than the
previous ones.
    The famous Military Battle which has
[allié] for a long time appeared there
finally imminent. Nothing more than the enemy could have destroyed by the finished state of
of the King's Household to do, and the
[tendancerie] to disarm; one
frightens all that one could not
subsist as it is at present.
    The position and state in the
finances of Mr Amelot, is
given to Mr de Barges, formerly
Intendant of Bordeaux.
They have given the Survivorship of the
Position, to Mr Amelot, Son. He will have
it on the same Conditions at 28 Years,
and as he is only 18, they are going to
have him pass through different Offices
of the Magistrature.
