The Prince of Condé, because of his
opposition, will not preside this
year over the Estates of Burgundy;
it is the Champenois of the Court of Peers
who will replace him, as Commander
of the Province.

The Count of Clermont d'Amboise
will return to Court instead of
the Canelles d'Ambuyalency; he had
previously only that of
Plenipotentiary Ministers.
M. de Souza will take the same
rank.

The Royal German Regiment
that the late Prince of Holstein
had is given to the Count of Logue.

It is reported from Rouen, that never
has the [ci-devant] Parliament judged
so many Cases, and so well; as does
presently the Superior Council
of that City; and as the Superior
Council of Bayonne is of little
importance, it is claimed that it will be Suppressed,
and merged with that of Rouen.
