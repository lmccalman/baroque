Rotterdam 9bre 9e 1561.

Private.

My Lord

the inclosed Paris letter contains so many
particulars upon the Schemes for redeeming the
french finances, that I thought it of my duty
to transmit it to your Lordship.
However great all these Schemes may be in
theory, it is easily seen that the execution
will be very Difficult.
I have no letters from my Madrid correspond
