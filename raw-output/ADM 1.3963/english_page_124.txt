            Aranjuez the 28. May 1776.

                There arrived at Cuelice
the 19th of the Current, Two Divisions of
Spanish Troops, the 1st was from the
Regiments of Murcia, and the Battalion
Rome, consisting of Seven Hundred men, the three
of December. They loaded Twenty
One Million and Two Hundred Thousand
Strong Piastres in [Rigement] of the King of [Etas];
8 Thousand Arrobas of Cacao from Guayaquil,
and 8,500. Arrobas of [Lozingienhas].
        They left at Cuelice Two
Merchant Ships, whose Registers
were [omestas]; they should have
departed the Third of March, until
one believes that they will also bring
about Two Million Piastres
or Pesos; and for three to Four Hundred
from Guayaquil. The latter will not bring
as much as one expected of it, one
                                    counted
                                    523
