134.

The [S.] this Parliament being assembled,
one of the Messieurs [de nomée] that the Parliament
of Paris was in the intention of supporting
that of Rennes. After much Debate
it was decided that they would write to the Parliament
of Paris to thank them for the Part that it
had taken in their Situation, then afterwards
that they had spoken during the Deputation
that was sent to them, and they will come all
Copies of the Decree of [S.] March, and of the
Remonstrances of that same Time.
The next day, Copy of the same Object
was given, to the Hotel of the Council, which
copied the Decree of [S.] March, and Copy of
last Remonstrances. They wanted
[impets], that they would not assemble the [repre]
Judge the Duke de l'Aiguillon, and that they [le do]
[on] Retament definitively on the
Two Procureurs General.
The fermentation is here [a que]
ever, both on the occasion of the
Hatreds and Divisions between all
the Families. One does not know when
all this will end.
