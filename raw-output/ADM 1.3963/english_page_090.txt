Ministry: That one may well be
proper to make him regretted.

One does not doubt, that all his

successor, and for the general regard
of the current Ministry, equally
opposed to His. It became that
Mr. de Maurepas must henceforth
see by the Finance Projects, can only
confirm the Public's Fears, if one
does not like Innovations;
and he is however more than once,

less making some of his
Councils: so that one does not
doubt, that this was one of the
causes of his Dismissal.

One affirms, that Mr. de Maurepas,
not only opposes at the Finance
Council, but that even
                    Ministers.
