                    Paris March 9, 1770.

                                        News has been gathered
from our Ports today.
        Our Excellent General Bourgoust
will be broken, is occupied in a few days
in the Departments of the Ministers, he
intends to make these Ministers give Account
of the Use of their Millions. This
affair will have Consequences, and will lose from [Bouché].
        The Edicts which are in Parliament
undergo the most serious Examination. The Judicial
constitution seems no more than 40 Millions.
        All these [Saveurs] put Abbé Terray
in a position to [proffrer] them from [Bourguises], which
[soudoient] the Flames at a Price where out of where,
which is a real Advantage.
        The King's Commissions which met
for the Examination of the 4 Edicts at Dubenton's,
gave Account Tuesday of their work
to the assembled Chambers, and after
Debates and deliberations, it was decided
that there would be made very humble
Remonstrances on these 4 Edicts, which were all
Rejected: 1st, because the Edicts
Will be sent, these Remonstrances,
are no longer for the Farm.
