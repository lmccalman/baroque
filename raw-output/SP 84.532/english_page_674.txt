Brest the 2nd June 1795

We are in
the Expectation of some Operations of
our new Ministry, It is not well
announced until now, and have found much
Hostility and Confidence with the
Chiefs, He could give Instructions,
and distribute the man of spirit and head says
Repertory of 8m 55 terms to the King
in the Navy, if Desormeaux who
had under the last Minister, by
Chipelle and Grange, lives with Mr De Graville
who supported him, of the [Conne] end of People
who exist Duty and Order
for Themselves and who dismissed him with
Religion to even satisfy
their Cupidity.

One counts on making a Promotion, but
it is necessary to think of arming
Vessels for the Marine Officers the
Sailors, and so that one no longer doubts
that france has a Navy, for soon
Foreigners will no longer believe it.
Only Scandal here, and in the greatest
fright.
