Considerations

upon the German Settlers that have for several
years past gone from Germany to His Majesty's
Dominions in North America.

1.) The Spirit of Emigration began in the Palatinate
in the later six years of the Silentary; From these
Persecutions drove a great Number of the Palatians,
Inhabitants from the Names, some Settled in the
neighbourhood of the House of Brandenburg, but the
most considerable part were transported to New
York at the Expence of her Majesty of England,
in the last years of the Reign of Queen Anne.

2.) In the two following Reigns November last
two Instances of Palatines being transported from
hence to America at the Expence of the Publick;
the one that of the Saltzburgers and Vaudois to
Georgia; the other of Germans or different
Sects, or the Emigrants to Halifax, of the Province
of Nova Scotia, or La Chapelle.

3.) The great Success, by which the first Germans
carried to their Countrymen of their Reception
and Usage, together with that Liberty,
and the Connivence, both Religious, Civil,
in their own Native Country, encouraged the
Spirit of Emigration, and extended it from the
Palatinate to other Parts of the Empire. Such
as Wirtzbourg, Westernberg &c; and in the Year
1740 great Numbers of Germans came down to
Rotterdam
