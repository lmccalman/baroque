                                  Paris, January 25, 1776.

                                            We have
nothing New from Boston. It is reported
from Rocheford, that the Trois Pontre was going
to Depart from there for Boston.
      The King's affairs were discussed
in the Prussian Admiralty on the 6th of this Month
and the Tribunal rendered in the
afternoon, no more than the Parliament,
the Council must decide.
      Last Night [Ce. Moury] whom I had
[le tant rendu]: Went to each
Member of the P. Parliament, to
Notify them of a very express order from the
King, by which [enfait] to declare,
if he would sign an Order that commanded him
to rejoin the First President, he said
that he was deliberating on it, and that he
wanted an opinion [en un Ris]. There are some
who said yes, and others
no.
      The Members of Parliament who
refused to Sign the acceptance of
the amnesty and the King's Letter presented
by the Musketeers, have been exiled
50 or 60 leagues from Paris, some at
40, and others less far or at
[ligne], only two remain, the whole
                                                                           assembled
