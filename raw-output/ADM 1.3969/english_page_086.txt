Paris the 12th May 1782.

Mr de Grimouard, commander
at [devait] the Lord of St Canone, and
Mr des Thurin, Ship Captain
have arrived at Brest safely. They had
departed from Cap St. Domingue the 29th March
last, by a new Sentinel
in to Europe of the very near arrival
of the [figmes]. They confirm the Loss
of the Bourgogne and the Genone.

The frigates the Nymphe and the Amphitrite
were encountered by Two enemy Vessels,
the latter escaped but
the fate of the former is unknown,
which took Flight to the North.

The Letters from Martinique of
the Month of February report that there
they are continually provisioned
with all sorts of Refreshments
by Neutral Vessels, as well as
all the French Colonies
and that they feared nothing from
the enemy's Side.
