der at all hours; that is to say, to let out two or three
feet of the cable, & each time this happened, we ap-
proached closer and closer to death. This storm lasted
three days, with equal violence, without the wind having

The third day, we had no more hope. The seabirds,
no longer able themselves to sustain

The same fate threatened us; but I doubt that great
Philosophers would have endured the sight with more dignity,
than our old Sailors & our Pirate of Grenefey. They had

There is a presentiment that sustains us sometimes in
the greatest extremities. I said to myself: the wind is at
its greatest force, it cannot increase further; it has lasted
forty-eight hours, it cannot last forever. Now-
