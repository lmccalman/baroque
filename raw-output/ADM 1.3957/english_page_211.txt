R 6 June No. 2.

Paris the 26th May 1790:

The King of Sweden
who was said to be arriving in time, but the last,
will only take place Monday at Versailles because the
courier with the Letters Patent of the translation
has not yet arrived from Versailles.

The Counselors of Rennes who have been exiled,
presented on the 23rd a new Petition
to the Parliament of Brittany, which assembled
on the 20th postponed until June 25th, to deliberate on it,
and ordered that in the meantime a letter would be written
to the King.

The ambassador Mr. de la Chalotais has
had presented a Petition to the Parliament
of Paris, carrying Regulation against the
Duke of Aiguillon. The Chambers assembled
Friday ordered, that the matter was
too important to deliberate on it in the
Presence of the Peers; they were convened
for Saturday, but they did not come:
Saturday at the Palace, it was ordered, that they
would do nothing without the opinions of the Peers
preceded by the King; Consequently
the Peers of the King were charged to go
to inform His Majesty of the day that he
would wish to hold the Court of Peers.
