On Tuesday they published the three Edicts of which
people have spoken; that for the Ennobled, is
not registered.

Three others have been published since, one
suppresses the office of Treasurer-Receivers
throughout the Kingdom, another suppresses
the Bureaus of Treasurers of France and the
Bureaus of the Domain, and [recée] them to
unite them together. [J'me fais] only one same
body: Another orders, that the funds,
which will be found deposited in the Parlement
for the profit of the Mendicant Religious to the Parties
who have made them placed.

It appears from yesterday, that the King, by an Edict
will order the Princes and [Prs] to have
their Titles of Peerage verified at the
Parlement, within six Months, this [dette destins]
to destroy forever the Descendance.

The execution of the [Parens] is the only
thing that can obstacle the current Project
of the Parlements, [qu'il peut être préjiter]
of a peace in sum the time to digest everything.

It is well expected that at the [Parlen]
they will plead there without cease, the Marshal of Belle
Isle wanted to give the example, he would come
to gain there a considerable [brelot].
