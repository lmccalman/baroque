It is written from Mortaix, that Mr. de
Vergny has been declared incapable of
ever serving the King, and condemned
to six years of Prison. He has been taken back
by the Champ to the Château du
Taureau.

It is claimed that there has just arrived
in Constantinople a Turkish Courier,
accompanied by a Dragoman, who
had orders to deliver the Dispatches
only to Mr. de Vergennes, the Divan
not having wished that they pass
through the hands of the Ambassador of the
King at the Porte, we will know tomorrow if
the fact is true.

It is not believed that there will be
great Changes in the Ministry
at Fontainebleau, only one might
well give the Position of Controller
General, to Mr. de Jemac, former
Master of Requests.
