They have just conducted the Inspection of [Hnich]
frigates, they have not found one
in a State to transport Mr. de Ternay
to Isle de France, they are in the Fields
of this Shortage. The frigates with a
good [Régault], can still very well
make three or four Voyages to
America, but not for a long
Voyage.

They inspected yesterday at the wood the Belles
Poules, and the Aurore, which they had brought
expressly from Rochefort, they will decide
today which of these two
Vessels will be chosen for Mr.
de Ternay.
