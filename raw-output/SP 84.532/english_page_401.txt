& Antoine breathe nothing but blood and the

to impose, and to silence the [Démons]
that one hears from all Sides.

Brussels the 4th April 1790.

Lord Lieutenant first

Division of troops in parts, consisting
in the Regiment of Salem, having 6 Pieces
of Cannon, of 6 Charges of Powder, with 8

We await in this City twelve of

but without Cannons: each Regiment
that will depart.
