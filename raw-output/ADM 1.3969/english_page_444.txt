employed, except for pressing
Motives, specified in the Instruction,
and with Formalities, which will
greatly restrict the Usage.
This Letter having to be common
to all the Intendants, and to their
Subdelegates, will be printed.

It is a question of a Reform
in the Regular Orders, and of a
great Suppression of Convents;
this Work which has occupied for a long time
a Commission of the Clergy, is about
to emerge. It is also in part from
the Determination that has been taken,
to send back the Bishops and the
Intendants to their Dioceses
and their Generalities, because this
great Work must not be carried out
during the Absence of the Heads of
the Administration.
