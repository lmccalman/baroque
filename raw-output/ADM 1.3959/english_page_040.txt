176.

The King has sent a Declaration
to the Parliament, bearing the interpretation
of the Letters Patent which were published
two months ago, concerning the
Profs and Reserifs of the Court of Rome;
the Parliament has sent it back to the Commissioners
to examine it; one does not know quite
exactly what it contains.

The Parliament Monsieur the Duke
of Orleans has had the Ecclesiastical Pension
newly granted to Mons. d'arcq given, but
as one feared his [son de gagner];
one wants for him absolutely to register
the Continuation of the [l'ung d'autres];
he has made to this [?] come a man the
violent, by sending back this decision
to the next Assembly of the States.
The Ministry piqued, has sent to this
Pr Condé Letters of Cachet,
with injunction to sign, under
Penalty of being punished. It remains to be seen
what will come of it.
