The Polish Princes settled at the
Domain at M... on September 15th same
of Mr de Repleteau, the Prosecutor of the
Count, but I will be then in exile there, I must
not go there.

There is a Refuge of the Savages
in St Malo, [faut] to a Priest
to call himself thus; the Bishop of St
Malo I found at this Moment
in Paris, but I am assured, that
Mr de La Chalotois wants
to provide to these Refuges to the
Parliament of Rennes.

The Wars recommence
between the Clergy and the [Rotep].
