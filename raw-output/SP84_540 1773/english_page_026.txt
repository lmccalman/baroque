Rotterdam 24 March 1773

Sir

I have received the Honour of
your Letter of the 26 past by Lord
Sheffield's Approbation of my Conduct.
Nothing will be wanting on my Part,
as much as I may have it in my Power,
to merit more the further Approbation
and Protection of His Lordship. By
my constant Zeal and warm Attachment
to the Interest of Government.

By the last Mail I had the Honour
to transmit to you another Letter
from the same Person, and if He does
not continue His Correspondence
with me, He shall will not be mine.

Recommending myself to the
Continuation of your kind favours,
I have the Honour to be with due Respect

Sir
your most humble &
most obedient Servant
L.D. Hake

W.m Fraser Esq.
