Sir

     Prince Gallitzin at the Hague
has received a Letter from the Prussian
Ambassador at Warsaw, dated the 12th
October, in which he says:
     Count Romanzov has informed me
by a Courier, that at the same Head
Quarters of the Grand Vizir, he has
agreed with him, not only in prolonging
the Cessation of Arms for Fourty Days,
but to renew the Negociations of Peace
with him, as also as the Turkish
Plenipotentiaries for that Purpose
should be arrived at his Head Quarters.

I have the honour to be with due Respect,

                                                       Sir

[SEAL]                                    your most humble and
                                          most Obedient Servant
P. Stephens Esq.r                                J.D. Hache
