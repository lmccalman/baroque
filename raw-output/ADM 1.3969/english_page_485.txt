it was brought to Versailles by
the Count of Mercy, who received it yesterday
in the country, where the Courier from
Vienna went to find him.

The offices having been closed yesterday,
it is thought that there will soon be a Counter-
Order for the Officers of the Army,
who instead of the 15th of January, will not go
to join until the 15th of April.

The Reports from Strasbourg confirm
what had been foreseen, concerning
the Desertion of the Imperial Troops:
fifty Soldiers entered
Strasbourg, Arms and Baggage.
Forty of them took Service
in the Regiment of Profé Dauphiné,
the Ten others crossed the border.
Since this Affair, the Austrian
Officers have disarmed their
Soldiers, and have them guarded in
Houses, where they entered, by
Sentinels and trusted Patrols.

The Emperor.
