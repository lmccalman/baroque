for this; in order to prevent similar
Incursions in the future, the Viceroy
of Peru having orders from H.M. to do
everything He would request for the
King's Service. He wants with him
no other General Officers than
Messieurs de Kavia and de Germena
both Field Marshals;
Mr de Vertiz, General Commander
at Buenos Ayres, to serve
until further notice, as Lieutenant
General, and whom He orders to obey in
& I dare claim it. But what
is to be noted, is that He
wants with him no Creature
of Mr de Riela.

My Letters from Cadiz of July 30

frigates of the King, the Alcide, and the Dame
French of Rd de Cuville to the Philippines
This past January, richly loaded
with goods, Medicines, and Drugs from
China.
