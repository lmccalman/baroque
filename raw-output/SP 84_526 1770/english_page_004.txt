Pondicherry the 30th June 1769.

Pondicherry is still blocked
for Commerce, the War has ravaged everything;
all the Surroundings have been burned.

Andronique has not discovered since
which left from our Neighborhood. He
put into considerable Port, where he was
joined by Hyder, who put in the army
Honorable there are about Sixty thousand men
Before; who came from the most enough; a
woman of the most Coquettish; who has a great
pride.

Andronique went to attack Hyder, hence
to return as soon as possible to [Phyges] near Madras;
the English invited him [funis] by their
Arrangements, and now we
Andronique furious holds the Seats of the
Council of Madras.

It has been 9 months that he has not kept our time;
the great Henry and the Ports are his.

We struggled the Mourning [un les Deuadés], this
[chantquel] has arrived us some Boats of
Rice and Provisions, everything is out of Price,
our Council does not appear at all moved by it.

Om.
