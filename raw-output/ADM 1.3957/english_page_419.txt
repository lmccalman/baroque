Comptroller General for the circumstances
which took place in the Indies, which expose to him the
needs and the questions which could resolve
in relation to the two Orders contained
in the opinion of the clerks.

The Duke of Durras responded to these
Demands by his letter, that he had
[ville] Correspondence of this episode, that the
estates will be able to satisfy fully, and that he
will employ the executive attention to
support the Demand of the Estates.

The Letter was read, the Reading was
approved, and it was delivered
to the Duke of Durras to be sent
immediately by a very
extraordinary Courier to the Ministry of
finances. This Affair occupied all
the Sessions of the 30th and of the SS.

The Vessel that Mr Durras built
this summer at Le Havre, is named the Pacific,
but it is for the Account of a Merchant
and not for the King.
