Madrid the 28 May 1775.

They write to me from Ferrol
dated the 16th, that they had received there
the King's Orders to embark there
[de Suites], and Brigades which were found
in this Port. In Consequence they have
begun to disembark the said
Brigades, except the St Regiment of Br-
Camans, which has orders to carry all
to Cadiz the Marine Battalions,
to receive the Fleet which is found
in the said Port. It is unknown if the
said Brigades will remain at Cadiz, or if they
will return to the Department of
Ferrol.

They write to me from Cadiz, that they
had not received any order to disarm the
Fleet which is found in the said Port,
and that they were expediting the Crews,
that they would not disarm the said [vessels].

As soon as I will have received Letters
from Lima from last September,
I will have the honor of giving you
Knowledge of them
