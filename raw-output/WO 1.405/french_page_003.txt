I think it my duty to inform Your Grace of the particulars
of the Expedition made from the Port of St. Juan le Rio

which sailed, were the King Charles, commanded
by Lieutenant of Frigate Juan Antonio— Juen—
taucia commanded by Captain of Frigate Saint
Joseph Martin— the Chevauz Marin, commanded
by Dominique Poledo— and the Chevauz Pylgare,
commanded by A. Druzgora—
