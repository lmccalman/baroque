17th Market

Paris February 25, 1788.

It appears that the Gazette
of France is keeping Silent on the Subject
of the Dispatches from India; and the
Reasons that may delay their
Publication are unknown; our Politicians say
that the last Report of the Squadrons
was to our advantage.

It is assured that in the Course
of next Month, we will have
a definitive Judgment on the Matter
of the Annuity.

Upon the arrival of Mr. de Suffren; there
will be Without Doubt, another
Council of War.

We still do not know what
the Emperor will have demanded from
the Porte.
