You will do me a very great pleasure if
you send me the papers of which I spoke to you
in the letter. If they are not at your place, I
pray you to have them searched for at the Judge's, you
will find the door open. I have great need
of these papers without delay. I wish you in
good health and am with consideration Sir
your very humble and very obedient Servant

Cury
