Perhaps people have been upset since they
celebrated the Day of the Duke of Duffy
at the Cath. of Berlin like a
child, with Banquets,
Flowers, Desserts, and
Dances, and that they have not yet
made him a Dish in the Fashion
of the Day, I mean, a fine Parade
some good Military
Manoeuvre, embellished with
several Thousands of Musket
Shots, &c. But it must be admitted
that His Highness has a Kind
of Horror for Military Noise
and that He does not like the Smell
of Gunpowder. To hide
this little Defect, one says as
an Excuse, that one does not wish to mix
the Image of War and Combats
with agreeable Sentiments, and with the
fear that the Presence of His
Imperial Highness inspired.
