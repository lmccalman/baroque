                                                    14 9 May N° 2.

                        Paris the 30th June 1770.

                                            It is reported from Breslau
on the 18th May that the Count of Guerchy who must leave
the County of Vence for the King, has just passed through
the States of [Nois de Suien]; that Mr. the Count
of Orgy has seen nothing New in this City.

        Letters from Brest announce
nothing New.

        Those from Rome of the 16th May say, that
the Court desired that the Pope would be in agreement
with the Dauphin's Confessor, that it had thought that he
would go to declare to His Government the fear
of a general Pacification. The Bull for
the Dispensation of Marriages is ready, but
the Courts refuse the Plenitude, and
demand that it be modified in the treatment.

        They do not wish to approach at Ratisbon
the discussion of Matrimonial [Matrimonialement]
by [autoros Ellipsele].

        Cardinal de Bernis was to give
a Celebration on the 29th for the Dauphin's Marriage.

        The King responded with much of the King of the
[Belardent], that he refused to see the two of the
Months the 29th June; the Princes and Peers to
go to the Palace to receive
this Response.
