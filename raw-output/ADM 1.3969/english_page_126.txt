Genoa the 1st June 1782.

The Algerian Corsairs
infest our Coasts so much, that
Commerce is no longer Safe.
Everything is being prepared, consequently the
necessary in our Arsenal,
to build a Barque of
18 Cannon Pieces. The Senate has
also ordered the construction with
all possible Diligence, of Three
Feluccas of 7 Cannons each to
put us in a State to go against the
Insults of these Corsairs, and to
protect Commerce, the Merchants
being obliged to pay some
equitable taxes for this Protection.
   Mr. Camelin, former Doge, and
[elle Clergon], has built at his
own Expense, a small Vessel
of Beech Wood, (on which [mention]
21 Cannons, to protect his
Commerce, under the same Conditions
that the Senate will require of the Merchants
for the Convoy of their Ships.
