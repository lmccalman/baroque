Private Letter

                                          Paris, January 3, 1778.

                                          We are
no less impatient than you to know
the choice of Rules to replace the
Controller General; but one has not yet
been able to give in the vast Field
of Conjectures.

The Marquis de Monteyrand whom one had
one had for the Department of
War, is a very honest Man,
good officer, but in no way suitable
to be at the head of this Department;
this is what one confirms to him again well
by [de des] intimate Friends.

As for the Deputy of the [des]
Genablis of whom one continues to speak,
one says for two hours, that the
Count of Caunitz, uncle [un] Blanche,
if that is true, there probably is
the famous Treaty of Families, called
the Alliance with the Court of Vienna [et bas].

With our ordinary length
we [patons] up to our own Affairs
through our intriguing Residence.
