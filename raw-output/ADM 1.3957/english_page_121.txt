Brussels the 26 March 1740.

Saturday it was notified
to the Order at the Gates of the Towns, that if
in the Future any Person who reveals themselves
[as a] Deserter from France, must immediately
be conducted to the Gate that would lead
to the Place where they wish to go, Without
stopping in the Towns under any
Pretext.

I suspect much, and in the
last Week there were Verryff
and Arcy; they are in Cologne.
