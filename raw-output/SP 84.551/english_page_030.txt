Mediation of France; which does
not want War.

From dawn I am written to on Dated
the 7th Current, that the Duke of Chartres
there has must carried it off only having refused
all the Honors that they wanted
to give him - that two hours after the arrival
of the same day M. le Stes h, departed
by land for Gibraltar; M.
O'Reilley, &c; having assigned three
Companies of Cavalry, and a
cable, to escort him; and that
the French Nation proposed to him
to go Backwards there, with the [batails]
of Anniebas and [tre] to Ireland with the
illuminations, ball, &c

They indicate to me likewise,
that the last fleet departed for
Veracruz, has been valued at more
than 80 Millions of Piastres

And that there have just arrived
Two Vessels from the American Islands
richly loaded.
