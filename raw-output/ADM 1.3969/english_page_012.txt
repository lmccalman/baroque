two more anchors, they were cast, the East wind kept
increasing. While waiting for it to cease, they began
to drink.

At seven o'clock in the evening, the storm was certain, & the
danger imminent; but they hoped that the wind would not blow
violently enough to break our two cables;
they began drinking again, & sleep drove away the fear of
shipwreck; but I, unfortunate, did not sleep at all.
What was my terror, seeing the [vivrant] break from
the strain of the cables, & the Ship pushed onto the rocks,
with the speed of an arrow. One minute, one instant later,
it would have been over, waves faster than lightning, &
which rose up to the clouds, with the most frightful noise
that irritated nature can produce, would have crushed us
to the last man, on the enormous rocks of Mevagissey.
Then the prize Captain is awakened, & all this new
Crew. The sleep of drinkers is heavier than that
of other men; their limbs are still numb,
when they are thought capable of acting: with incredible
efforts, we finally manage to pass the cables around the
mainmast, & to hold them with lashings.

It must be admitted, in these terrible moments, the English
are courageous, & with the exception of a few passages
from the Bible, which the oldest sailors had between their
teeth, I perceived no impression of terror. But
we were now only a stone's throw from the rocks of Mevagissey, our damaged cables threatened to break;
one had run out to 80 fathoms; in vain they renewed
what Sailors call the Service (that is to say,
cloths coated with tallow, which surround the cable at the
places where it bears on the wood of the Ship) it was necessary [rossais].
