166                                                    Rés au 1781

St. Ildefonse, September 20, 1770.

I am informed from Cadix
on the 11th, that three Vessels watch carefully
that no one comes aboard the Frigate
St. Catherine, but that despite this
Rigor one knew presently, that
the Vessels had come from the Malvinas Islands
in 68 Days, and that it was commanded
by Mr. de Rudemaire, who had made
the Expedition against the Island of Valkenaer, and
that it had on Board several English Officers
from this new Colony.

One awaited the return on the 14th of this Month
of the Express who had been dispatched for
the Admiralty Victoria to the Court.

The Regiment of Pavia in Garrison
at Cadix has orders to embark shortly
for the two Regiments that one prepares to
send to Buenos Aires, are destined to
go to America. I am informed
also from the Levant, that two Warships
have departed from there for Cadix,
to convoy the said troops.
