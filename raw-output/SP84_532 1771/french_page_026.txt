On the left block of text, I can see a dense paragraph of 18th-century French handwriting. However, due to the image quality, angle, and the cursive nature of the script, I cannot make out enough individual words with sufficient confidence to provide an accurate transcription of the full text.

On the right side, I can partially make out what appears to be:

Monseigneur
[signature or closing phrase that is not fully legible]
