Genoa the 1st October 1782.

By my last I announced
to you, that M. Gallera was having
constructed at St Pierre de Morenas two
Galliots. Last Week he
had the larger one launched to Sea,
it is taken for 26 Cannons, and of
Capacity of 3 to 4 Thousand Quintals. It is M.
Andre, Merchant here, who purchased it,
for Account of a Merchant in Marseille.

The second of the said Two
Vessels will be launched at the first
Day, which is taken for 18 Cannons,
and of Capacity of 3. to 4. Thousand Quintals.
