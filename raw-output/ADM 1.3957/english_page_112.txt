Procedure of Brittany, with strong
Qualifications, and a great Eulogy of the
good Administration of the Duke
of Aiguillon in Brittany.

They have dispatched for 15 Days Two
extraordinary Commissioners to Corsica.
It is not known why.

They continue to assure, that the
Arrangements between France and the Pope
are finished, and that soon they will return the
Comtat of Avignon.

Our Letters from Rome of the 19th announce to me,
however nothing extraordinary.
