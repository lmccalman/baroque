Brest the 18 December 1776.

We are beginning again to
believe a little in Peace; they
are arming three 74-gun Ships, to
join the Squadron that is waiting
in the Roads; the Captains
have not yet been named.
The Minister orders, to keep
ready all the others, His
Majesty's attention being to have them
armed successively.
There has been since an order, to arm a
vessel the Terrier, to convey
Dispatches from China to our
Colonies.
The brigantines from Rochefort,
the Suffisant, and the Diligente,
which had been detained here,
have orders to return to
Rochefort, to be disarmed there.
