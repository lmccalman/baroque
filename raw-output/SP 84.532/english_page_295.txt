N°20.

Paris the 4th March 1773.

The Letters de cachet have
confirmed the Ship's Captain and they have
Beaten the Battle Generals
first and Workers controlled in Paris.
Really this this Department
has arrived in Paris.

Our Letters from Brest of the 2nd and Toulon say, that they
are Beginning there the loading of the squadron of
the Port, but they have sent a thousand other Dauleurs
who protect the Boulognois.

There are always the bad troops. Many of them
are lacking and it will be necessary to resort again
to include others up to the Number of 15
18 to 20 Thousand Men.

A packet from the Orient of the 2nd. Vessel of
two loads, of which 5 for China.

They have named Monsieur d'imprimes, those
who will help to take these Boatmen in the
[ecchelines]. It is perceived that Mlle St Dice
is occupied with the Means of [retailler] it.

It appears however, that Mlle d'ormoy
wanted to Seek another means to
preserve only the familiar corps for, it for
the idea Boulogne for provisioning it, and the
point the last is presented in
Royal finance to prefer to Lon Jules.

Our Pt. gives the towns under the Balons
an eye which will support the Right of Committimus.
