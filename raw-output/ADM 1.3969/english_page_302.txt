Paris, February 2, 1784.

            Word comes from La Rochelle,
that the Gabarre la Plume, commanded
by Mr. Penson, Ship's Ensign,
has been in the Roads; and must leave at the first
good Wind, to go carry the forces
to Cherbourg. The object of this Dispatch appears
to be the Work of the Caissons, of which one
must make the Trial next Summer;
to form the Roads of Cherbourg.
Orders are given at Rochefort
to have brought there the frigate la
Danae of 40 Cannons, the Corvette la
Phaeton; and the Cutters le Brulleur, le
Turcolait, and le Gerfault.
            Word comes from l'Orient, that
there have arrived Two merchant Ships,
loaded one with Coffee, the other with Cotton
from America, and le Rhenny, they
announce several others, which
cannot delay in arriving.

                                                                        Seen.
