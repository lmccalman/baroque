The Grumblings of the Merchants
of Nantes never end; 
they are every Day new
Petitions and new Memorials.
Those of Bordeaux are more reserved;
If the Permission granted to
Foreigners by the Decree of 30 August,
strikes a Blow to their Speculation
and to their private Fortune,
They have at least the good Sense
to see, that Millions of Individuals,
and great Colonies, must
not be punished for the Interest
of Two or three Ports of the Kingdom.
