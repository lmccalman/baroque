17.13 July

                        Extract
from a Letter from an Officer of the State
[from] Louisbourg of the 11th of June 1758.

We fortunately entered here
the 29th May, and the Bizarre and the Heureuse the
next day, not without anxieties, for an
Enemy frigate observed us well—
fortunately for us the Wind had moved away
from the Port the English fleet which has been cruising there since
the 30th March.

We found here the Prudent (Chagrimant
the Celebre, the Capricieux the Bienfaisant,
the Apollon, the Fidelle and the Comette.

Mr du Chaffault entered Port Dauphin,
he will have difficulty getting here, for the
number of Enemy Vessels increases every
day before this Port.
