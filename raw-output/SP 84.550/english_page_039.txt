Rotterdam January 7, 1776.

Sir,

By today's Post
I have the honor to send you
apparently the Tables
belonging to the Work
named, by the two preceding
Posts, and which complete
the said Work.

They wrote to me again, by the
last from Leipzig Muhlynn,
[présent. sur Alles], that he has not at all?
Learned in that Country there, where they
named them to me, at the Rate of three
Hundred Florins for the Year;
and that they wrote to me today [il fait
pas cliois], but that twice
-
One awaits with [du Regne],
If there is one [à - D'Altere]
Sir,
Your very humble and
very obed. servant
M. Wolters

P.S. [Avez bons? Quai?]
