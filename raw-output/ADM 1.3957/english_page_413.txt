Brussels the 15th October 1770.

A tour of observation of the Ordinance
on the Abbeys about which I spoke to you
was recently made.
The Letters from Silesia report that the
Count d'Anglan [protestar] the frontiers
of Poland, is very exact to leave them
perfect that the King's Hussars who
patrol, and who never return
from their Courses in Poland
without bringing back a good Number
of excellent Recruits; moreover
workers are sent to cut down
the finest Trees, which are transported
to Silesia.
