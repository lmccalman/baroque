The Marine troops that are going to form them,
will be commanded by
land Officers.
     Your Enemies here go from bad
to worse, the 38th Month is owed to the
Officers.
     Mr. d'Herouville has found our
Batteries in bad State, he is going
to examine the Outworks of Brest, to
see if there is a Means to fortify them,
one thinks that he will find that there
would be too much to do, and that it would require
too many People to guard them.
He visits not only the land,
but also all that concerns
the Marine.
