Brittany, in Normandy, & even

One had flattered oneself, that the new
Edict, concerning the Masters in,
would have yielded Money, to
provide for the extraordinary Expense

one is at Expedients to provide
for the Lack, but this is only
for the Moment: One must consider
during this Journey, by what
Means one will provide for the Expense
of [Lise]. One believes that, given the sincere Will
in which the King is, this cannot
cause Bankruptcy or [proprofane]
Help
