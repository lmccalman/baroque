Madrid, July 28, 1783.

The Letters from Alicante of the
22nd of the Current month report, that the Town
[Dont'esralo] had set sail, and taken
the Open Sea from St. Paul, with all
the Expedition under his Orders; [la Bonteline
generale], thus Mr. Balland, may be
arrived before Algiers at the hour that
is. Rough weather had obliged him
to take refuge at St. Paul, which is
three Leagues from Alicante.

An Extraordinary Courier from
Cadiz, arrived at the Court, three
Days ago, brought us the news
of the arrival in that Port of Mr. d'Estaing,
with the first Convoy; half of
the Squadron of Mr. Solant, has remained at
Havana, to escort the Second
Convoy, which is expected throughout next
Month, with the Troops that
must return to Europe with
Mr. Galvez, Nephew of our Minister of the Indies.
