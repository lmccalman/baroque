to register Letters Patent, which
reexamine all that has been dealt with in
the Registers against the Duke of Orleans,
& the Parliament against the Duke of Charolois,
however with an Act of Protestation
in their name & of recurrence in case of total usurpation by the
Parliament, after which all
Members are sent back each to Their home, with
Prohibition from having anyone there, and from sending
into the Salon, the Dukes who wished to
receive them for their Protestation; which they
did. 37 Members who had no
fruit from their one Protestation of the
strongest, were seized in the same
manner by Vandeval in the Places which they
had Themselves indicated;
38 other Members who had not
taken the Protestation, were not
seized; they were to form the foundation
of the New tribunal which was to be
installed this Morning the 26th, by completing it
up to the Number of 50.
I remain still at Dijon, and the assembly
whose operation was fixed for this
Week, and all will be finished; the Marquis
de la Tour du Pin commanding in
