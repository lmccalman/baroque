Hag Dett

Paris the 10. December 1784.

There are Reasons to believe,
that as much the Hope of a Reconciliation is
not lost. One knows with Certainty,
that the Troops coming from the Bretignes,
have been stopped in their March,
and one from this such Consequence, that,
since these almost at the Edge of
their Course, have received Counter-Order:
the March of those which come from
Places more distant, must likewise
have been prevented. Others
regarded these Consequences as
false, and said, that the Emperor
could well have the Intention to
make the Troops arrive in Army Corps,
and not by small Platoons.
Whatever it may be, the Response of
the Emperor announces Dispositions
on the part to an Accommodation.
