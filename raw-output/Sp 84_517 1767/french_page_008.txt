Sir

        It is with the deepest sense of
Affliction, that I have received by the
honour of your Circular Letter of the 17th

melancholy News of the Death of his
Royal Highness the Duke of York.
        Permit me to present to you my
most sincere Condolances upon an
Event which will be so Sensible to the
King, and to all His Majesty's Loyal
Subjects.
        I have the honour to be most
Respectfully,
                Sir

                        your most humble and
                most Obedient Servant

                                R. Wolters
