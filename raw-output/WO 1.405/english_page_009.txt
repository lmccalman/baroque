setting out at the Porta of French Carlz, in hopes
was Malaca. at the Strength my information
patience, I got a knowledge that two French Captains
just arrived from Carlz and Carthagena, who
informed me that the above Report was without
foundation, but said that several Reports were
arrived at Coment from some other Spanish
Ports, which intelligence made me divid my Compy,
Paris; and upon the most minute and Strictest
enquiry I was assured that at the same time these
frigates and two large officiale were arrived
who equipped the foreign Service, and that
some time ago a Report had circulated that
twenty ships of the line and frigates had been
ordered to be fitted out, even with half their
Complement of Men which was understood to
be stationed at the Governor's field. I upon
such an information presented to him, his
Reasons would have been much more convincing,
and probably might not have been answered
with more Success. I therefore thought it more
prudent to wait here, without incurring farther
expenses of Seamen mostly. I have moreover only
in view for the unavoidable expenses which I
was put at without obtaining any thing for
                                                                                           myself.
