which must be ready to set
Sail on May 3rd, will join at Sea
three other 64-gun Ships and a frigate,
together 6 [Executifs] and 4 Fireships. These
Vessels will disarm at Brest, which
will form the Royal decides the Ministry
to abandon the Port of Rochefort and
to Devote for our expedition,
these are fewer Places for the Corps
of the Navy, not counting the Vessels
which marry the Officers who have been
established equally in this Port.

   You know Sir very certainly
