I declare to give all the ready money that
I may have at the moment of my death, and my personal effects
to Demoiselle De hont my granddaughter, and
after her to the heirs, taking the son
before the daughter, and so on until extinction.
The acquired property shall always be divided according
to the Custom of Paris between the survivor and the
heirs of the deceased
And the present Resolution shall be valid
however informal it may be
And this even devoid of formality
