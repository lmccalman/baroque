                            Paris the 27 June 1784

                    The letters from our Ports provide
         nothing interesting, everything there
         continues in the same state.

                    One continues always to speak
         of the formidable alliances that must
         form in Europe.

                    With regard to our mediation
         to adjust the dispute that arose between
         the Emperor and the States-General, His
         Imperial Majesty finds the mediation
         of France superfluous, because the matters
         as little litigious, as those treated
         by the General Government of the
         Provinces with the Dutch commissioners.
         He does not perceive it that
         France does not grant good
         offices to the Republic, but
         good offices do not make a
         mediation.

                                                                                                      One
