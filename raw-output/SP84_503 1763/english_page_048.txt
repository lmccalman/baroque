London for his Majesty's american Dominions
are kept in jail at Plymouth till the time
of their departure, and that one Gilbert their
chief was so imprudence as to bear threatening

I have the honour to be

                                        Sir
my worthy friend and                    your most humble
neighbour me Cradford                   and most obedient
desires his compliments to you.         Rudolphe
