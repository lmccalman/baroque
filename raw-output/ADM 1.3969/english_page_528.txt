# 29 January

Paris the 14th January 1785.

                    Without really knowing why
the rumors of war are recurring;
however appearances are for
peace, since instead of seeing
the preparations draw near, counter-
-orders have been given these last days
to the officers of the Swiss
regiments and to the replacement
captains of the other corps.
One would have liked, perhaps,
to treat in the same manner those who are
en route and so to speak at
the moment of returning, but it
was not thought necessary to stop them,
although all things considered, their
presence becomes absolutely
necessary in their respective corps

                                                    that
