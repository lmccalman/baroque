Prince Henry
of Prussia is expected here at the end of this month.

When the parliament had registered
the King's declaration, bearing
an increase of two [lettres] ten
sols on the price of each [voge] of new
wood, and of 35 sols per thousand of floated wood,
it brought the other day to the foot of the
Throne its remonstrances on this subject.

The King desiring to encourage the
cutting of fine stones, and composition
stones, and wishing to procure for
artists, who will be distinguished by the
superiority of their talents in this genre,
the faculty to exercise it, has, by a decree
of the council of July 17, 1784, ordered, during
the course of six years, a competition which
will take place on August 1st, next at the office
of the common house of the guild of goldsmiths
of Paris and to which will be admitted all
lapidaries without distinction, even foreigners,
they will find all necessary assistance.
