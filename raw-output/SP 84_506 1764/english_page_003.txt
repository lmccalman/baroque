Monsieur

I must tell you that having made the acquisition of this beautiful 
property which belongs to you for the sum of thirty thousand 
livres, I hastened to make known to your Majesty's family 
the extreme pleasure that I had in concluding 
such a transaction with you; your conduct toward me has been so 
noble and so generous that I take pleasure in making it known 
to everyone. I have received recently orders from Paris, 
to pay this sum into the hands of Monsieur le Comte 
de Vergennes to whom you have given your orders to this effect.
Receive Monsieur the assurance of my high consideration and of the 
distinguished sentiments with which I shall not cease to be 
your very humble and very obedient servant
