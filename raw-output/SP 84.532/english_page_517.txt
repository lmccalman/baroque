Cadiz the 5th April 1775.

                    The different
Militia Companies of this Province
which were in Service in this Place
during all the time that one feared
a Rupture with England,
have been sent back to their
respective Districts.

We have learned by Letters
from Gibraltar, that [l'occasion a'avoit rien]
of this Place in state, by the arrival of three
English Warships, which
must transport them to England,
so that there remains no more at
Gibraltar except those which arrive there
about three Months ago, to
reinforce the garrison in case of
War, or to replace it
if Peace continued.
