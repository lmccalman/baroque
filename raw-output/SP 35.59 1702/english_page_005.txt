in a private audience which he gave me
in his Chamber the Letter of Notification
that you sent me for him on behalf of
His Majesty; This Prince assured me that He would remain
always inviolably attached to His Allies
particularly with His Majesty with whom
He wished to maintain always a good and
close correspondence as He had done with the
King his Predecessor of glorious memory. I do not
doubt Sir that by this post one
will send to Mr. de Spanheim the Response to the
said Letter of Notification. I have delivered that
which you addressed to me for the King of Poland
into the hands of Mr. Wolters who resides here on
behalf in the quality of Secretary.

I have also informed this Court that His Majesty
had found it appropriate in this great conjuncture
to send Mr. the Count of Marlborough to Holland
in the quality of his Ambassador Extraordinary and
Plenipotentiary to give to the States General
Assurances of the firm resolution of His Majesty
