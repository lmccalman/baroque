                        Paris the 7th January 1773.

                        Reports from Bucharest
that there are orders to send to Brest all
that there is of [Vignettes] and Vessels
which are found in the ports of that empire of which
M. des Rennes for our Colonies, the
Regiments of line have left for Odbre
and Vrone

        Extract from a letter dated from Toul
the 3rd of the current one reports that there are many
troops in the Environs, but there are
still no Orders to arm

        La Repide and la Vergne would go via Rhine
to Metz

        Reports from Brest the 2nd that even
outside two Battalions and Artillery should
arrive there: it is this Corps that is charged
with the land Batteries that will be mounted at the
fort

        L'Union and la Loire [entrenoient] that
the Zephir ready to depart, the Zephir, les Reine,
and la Bellefunde go to the Roads.

        The change of Minister causes a
great Sensation, & they say that M de Boyne
is being chased from the land, and all are astonished
that there are known only [lngentaires] and
Regimes

        They continue to work [paysages] the
Side of the Vessels.
