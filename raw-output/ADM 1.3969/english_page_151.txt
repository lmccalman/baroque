Signatures required by the Disarmament
of the Frigates. The War Council will not
be the [Stours] responsible, since
the instruction should only focus on
Two Points. 1st. the Defense that
Count de Grasse made with his
Vessel. 2nd. If the Signals were
executed. They will not investigate
whether they were correct or not,
good or bad, the King having
approved them, it only remains for the
Council to approve whether they were
executed or not by the different
Chiefs of the Divisions.

It is claimed that the Recall of M. the
Count de Bellecombes, Commander at Cape
St Domingue, is resolved, and that he
will return by the same Vessel
that must bring back with him M. de
Rougane, Intendant of that Colony.
There is nothing interesting from
our Ports.
