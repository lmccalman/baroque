Rotterdam 27th March 1778.

My Lord

     As the Paris Correspondent of your Lord-
ship Comte of Hauterive, is now in France, I
apprehend his Letters to Me may not be so
frequent, that your Lordship may distinguish
them from his Letters, Did I enciose of the Marche
of this his Correspondent in a manner to lead to
suspect. His Correspondence has been to send to
your Lordship here inclosed those
intelligences received from him; with
which I shall continue during this War the
office of his Agent, which your Lordship has
been pleased to vest it me. To the contrary,
the Families of this Man have always
been sanguine, Time will shew what he
he can do.

I have the honour to be most Respectfully

My Lord

                                    Your Lordship's
                                    most humble and
                                    most obedient Servant,
                                    L.D. Flake.


To the Earl of Halifax.
