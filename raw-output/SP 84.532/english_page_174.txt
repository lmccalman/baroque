Brussels, February 7, 1777

It is believed that the Prince
of Stahremberg will leave soon for
Vienna; it is said that it is to
replace Count de Caunitz,
who intends to retire.

One has not received my last
from Brussels on the Health of the Empress
which makes one believe that things are
not so good, it is that Her Royal
Highness dined yesterday at Count de
Basteny's, where She said that the Empress
was working on January 26, 4 o'clock in the after-
noon, extremely, [ny met l'Obstacle].
