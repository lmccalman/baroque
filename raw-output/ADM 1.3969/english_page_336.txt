Paris the 13th March 1728,

We do not yet know anything
certain, about the turn that will be taken by
the Affair of Mlle Grangé. It is known that
a response has been made to Her last Memoir,
she is reproached for having altered the Sense
of the Letters that were written to Her, and
one has not gone so far as to
make use of certain Passages from the
Dispatches of Mlle Vaudreuil, to
the Minister. It is said on this Subject, that to
have Communication of these Dispatches
Mlle Grangé has [répondu] more than 30
Thousand Livres in the Bureaus of
the Marine.

They are giving the Regiment of
Gnaune to Mr Ducparcilly, and that
of Marshal de Turenne to Mr de
Morepois. Mr de Senneterre not remaining
in the Colonel General, will be replaced
by Mr de Richelieu Dragoons.
