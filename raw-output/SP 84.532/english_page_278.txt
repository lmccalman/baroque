Geneva the 20th February 1775.

I have not written to you
for some time, because all
our News consisted only of Conjectures,
which changed from day to day, According to the
circumstances of the times.

The most recent News that
we have from France, inform that
the King is not less than well
disposed toward Mr. de Maurepas, and that one speaks
of [renté des dernier Reconnus demembr]
between between the Courts of London and
Madrid, and that in the States of France
one will open yet another Order for this [éclat]
the Preparations for War. It is
therefore only time that will inform us all.

Since the Disgrace of the Duke of Choiseul,
all work at Verssy has ceased. This
last country was to the Kingdom of
France the honor of becoming the Heart
of the Kingdom and was to have three complete
up to 30 men and Knights.

It is even assured, that the County of France
and the Robe will return again and before
to this City.
