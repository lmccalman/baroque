Rotterdam may 9th 1793

My Lord Duke -

Last thursday night arrived at Texell -
a Ship from the Dutch settlement of Johanna -
with an account that a party of Negroes had
revolted against their Masters, on the 20th of february
last, and had, when the letters came away destroyed
three or four Plantations, in one of which they had
murdered the Planter and his Clerk. -

Another Ship came in the night before last
but I have not been able to learn what she has
brought, if further particulars, or only a confirmation
of the first news -

A party of a Sergeant and twelve men was sent
out against the Negroes, but could not find them, the
weather being with other Rains that are from the
first.
