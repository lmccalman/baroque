when the Ships from the Levant loaded with wheat
for Marseilles there appeared upon repeated will
hurt the french much as they are in great want
of this commodity. -

As to the Grain being supplied from Russia I see
no great likelihood of it accepting that the merchants
here and the Jew in great Britain that will do
wheat to france will make use of Dantzic and
Wotpolar Ships till they find out that this way is not
Safe then them begin before -

I do not see any great disposition here to take
our letters of Marque, most of the Merchants are of
opinion that their guineas are not in earnest, and
others think it kindly worthwhile to Privateer in
Europe; I hope at least that the East India Company
will take the hint given them by the States and to
france; there was a general offering last week of all
the united Companies, but I have not been able to learn
yet what Resolution they are come to. -
