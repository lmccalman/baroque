St James's May 5th 1771.

Madam,

Mrs W. Percie                    In the Absence of
                                 Ld Halifax, who is not yet
                                 recover'd from his late Illness,
                                 I wrote this to acquaint You,
                                 in answer to Your Letter of the
                                 21st Ulto, as the Sieur Le Comte's
                                 Services have hitherto given no
                                 Proof of that Ability to be
                                 useful to which He pretends,
                                 I think you will do well to
                                 give him Notice that he will
                                 not be continued after the
                                 Expiration of the Three Months
                                 for which You agreed to make
                                 Trial of Him.
                                                    I am &c
                                                    Rochford.
