It shall be said to the Envoy of Tunis
that the King is willing to permit him to
return to the Prince of Tunis, but
that His Majesty desires that he make his efforts with the Prince of Tunis by
making them see that if there were reason to continue a Commerce between the two crowns
the corsairs of Tunis and Algiers would no longer be in a position to harm the French
& Mahonese. His Majesty hopes that the
entreaties that he will make will have been heard by him.
