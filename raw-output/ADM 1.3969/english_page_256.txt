Departure of Mr de St Priest from
Constantinople, while assuring however,
that Mr de Choiseul Gouffier must
replace him. Mr de Sibme must
leave Petersburg the 10th of this Month.
The Decree of the Council of the 27th
of September, concerning the Discount
Bank, and that of the 30th to
forbid the transport of Specie
were only published last Friday.
The Alarm was then at its height,
especially when one saw the same Day
the Lieutenant-General of Police go
to the Bank to examine
its Balance Sheet. He left very satisfied.
Not only does the Bank possess
all the representative Value of
its Notes, but also 46 Millions
more, that is to say that it could
still grant a Credit of 16 per
Cent, to each of its Notes. One hopes
that before long, all will be calm.
