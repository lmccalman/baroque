Rotterdam June 18th 1780.

My Lord Duke,

By a ship arrived from Surinam we learn
are letters of the 9th of March N.S. which say that
after destroying the plantation of Bethlehem, the
Revolted negroes fled with their families, in
well provided with ammunition, were resolved
to march forward, but that a Captain of Burgoighs
with his company resolutely marched out, and after
a very difficult and dangerous march of four days
and four nights had, defeated and dispersed them
in such a manner that it is thought they must
perish in the morass; thirteen were killed in the
action, and thirty three were prisoners to be four.

I do not hear what effect this will have
upon the intended undertaking, but am always
more

His grace the Duke of Bedford.
