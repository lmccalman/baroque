P.S.  Here is the Summary of the King's Response to
the Delegation of the Parliaments of
Paris of the 23rd of January. "I only suppress them
that three consecutive Wars obliged him
to make; have greatly weakened the Revenues
only by the diminution of the Object in the
Subjects and no Tax since the last
Peace

The [Sç] is resolved to bring to the
Expenses all possible Economy
and to recover all that has been diverted
from his Revenues at any Price. But that if
after having brought all possible
Attention to Economy &c; these Means
do not suffice, He will be obliged to resort
to a new Tax; that then
Parliament can be assured, that it will be
the last that He will require of the good
Will and of his Zeal. That it is only
after having succeeded for
some Years in bringing Expenses
to the level of his Revenues, that He will be able
to begin to free his People from
some Taxes, beginning
with the most onerous.
