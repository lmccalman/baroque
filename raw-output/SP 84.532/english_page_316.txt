Madrid, February 25, 1793.

Someone writes to me from Cadiz that,
between December 11 of the year, and
January 5, which has passed, they received notice
of having 2 Ships of 70 moored,
and that they are stopping all the Armaments
of Spain, and of war both [d'appendez],
as [de nip] with the same [mutier]. Orders
to arm them to count the [Cors] for
themselves [des Speculateurs].

The Artillery Regiment which had in
fact [l'École du Casuel] for Carmes, a
few Days before the News of the
[Embarcas de Prise], is returned to
said Port, having been sent back for
the Burgos Catalonia which had been
called for this Effect.

Three officers embarked in
Barcelona to do it and transport from
the Island of Mallorca, to form Orders,
for the Fortification of said Island.

Someone writes to me from Cadiz, that they had
[felté] a Packet boat [à backer], to
go to the Island of Mallorca. And
