Paris the 18th of April 1782.

We await with Impatience
the News from India. We have
received some Official Dispatches
from England come by the Packet boat
of Rodney. It is believed from what
already transpires that there is talk of a Combat
of the 12th of September, but it is thought that
it is that of the 3rd of which they wish to speak;
what confirms it, is the State of the
Vessel the Illustre, which has been damaged,
& the admission that Hue makes in fighting
the Sultan, all that relates to
the Action of the 3rd of September.

News has been received from the Cap of
St Domingue, by the Vessel the Hercule,
arrived at Bordeaux. These Letters are from the
25th of January, and report, that M. de
Vaudreuil, was still on the Spanish
Continent, and that the Convoy departed from France
in the Month of September last had
not been able to force Porto Rico, but was blockaded.
