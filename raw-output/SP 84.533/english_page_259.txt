Vienna, October 30, 1795.

I have not written to you [b]
for two Posts, for lack of News that
are worth the Trouble, and if this should
happen again in the future, you would not
attribute the fault to lack of Zeal, nor to
that of my Attachment, which in such
tranquil moments consist in
this Collection of the same Letters, for to
have more important ones, Providence
requires of us long Prayers.

According to the News we had
from Bohemia, the Emperor's
Arrival there made several of the
Peasant women fall, one of the Scarcity in
this Kingdom, which they attributed there by
their excessive Miseries, the Emperor has
already given new orders on this
Subject, and is occupied with Arrangements
so that Grain no longer be lacking there.

The Archduke of Hungary, Arcoren-
Reihersdorf, did not even judge it appropriate
to await the Emperor's Arrival there,
but has departed, it is believed, to go
to Rome.
