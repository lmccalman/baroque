Second.

Madrid the 30th March 1778.

My latest Advices from
Poland dear S. of the 6th of this Month, report,
that Mr. Bourcke with his Cossacks,
was waiting there [King autres], detained,
the Dismissal by the Russians to the contrary.
That the two Regiments of Infantry
of the Duke of Saxony, and of Services;
[provisibnt] to be destined for them;
that one of Marche, to Cadiz, and that one
of Espania, [Plan deux], in America.
That [I] know not from where he had the advice
of appearance and the news
the Expedition, that there is, to judge
by the Armaments that one prepares
at Ferrol, and at Cadiz, one believes
that there will be something by
Sea; in general one believes that
it is for America, and to
respond to so many events.
