Paris, April 10, 1770.

Tranquil comfort

at Brest and at Rochefort.

The Minister of War that Mr. Bourgeois
could not provide contrary to Le Havre, and to the request
to the Company of the Indies, I was informed that you
would supply the Warehouse.

People were astonished by the Rarity of the Duke
d'Aiguillon, he despised all the financings
but he has everything to fear from the [Exhousiane]
of the Bretons, and even from the [Camisols].

This Affair is suspended until
May 5, the [Camisols] are going to arrive. The
Parliament is imprisoned of the No. Here we are
in a vacation of 15 days for
the Parliaments.

The Death of the Company of the Indies
makes a lively Sensation, among the Dutch
the Demand fills up for, and Expense
of 180 Million remains Without Success, all
that [allégoire] the Ministers of Finance
to change Battery, and one expects
to see appear [Portée] of [Los cuirottr].

There will be no [interrogeante]
since my last.
