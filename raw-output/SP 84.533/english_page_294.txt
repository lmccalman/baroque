always restarting this Work equally
disagreeable to the Ministry, and odious
to the Nation; one is always ready
when one wishes to familiarize
imperceptibly the French with the
third, current unusual Regiment,
and of which one was notified for the first
time in the last war: thus
without appearing to burden the People
extraordinarily, and by this
cleverly combined Reversal,
one will collect as much as [auroviant]
rendered the twentieths, or thirty
tenths, following the old Revenue system.

It is assured that Abbé Terray is currently
pushing hard to perfect
this Project, so that it will be ready by St.
Martin, and that one can effect it
without loss of time.
