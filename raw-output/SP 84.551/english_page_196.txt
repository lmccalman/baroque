that a very small number of printed Edicts
of the public, once the Decree of August 28, 1728, which grants only a provisional tolerance for practice, awaiting the Code, on the expectation that there would soon be Laws, if they have not, after it contrary ones; & that to enforce these Edicts introduced into the Kingdom, the Parliament which remitted it for printing, & which ordered the Edict; but it judged the form of the State & of these [partimens], they are not; that they be finally good, one must still observe them from 1738, that they not become bad; rule without being bad; that they become bad; for if on one side the Parliament of a State, & what has been obtained for 38 years.

Why does the Magistrate not order other Laws in the State, than the Edicts which he undertakes to have printed; he who possesses all of them in the repository of his Archives. All the proof, & that the Sovereign cannot except to the objects that the State will have conferred to the goal which had judged to establish them; by virtue of this axiom of law, faisit populum jurare in jus. As this public good, when he wishes; since his authority is not founded public would no longer exist, it is no longer in use; but on the anterior Edicts & that of 1668, & that the first article of the Edict of 1738 regards them as fundamental Law, from which derive the abuses, & if it would not authorize preference or rights & attributions of the different Orders which it confirms; not wishing that they be maintained, nor abrogate unless by a contrary Law; or Sovereigns, all the Edicts which establish them, be in force: & it is then the Parliament, & the Sovereign cannot abrogate these Laws or these customs, nor establish a promulgation implicitly; by the first article of this Edict of 1738, the Legislator cannot make the enumeration, had not been printed in its entirety, & ten days before there was usage, All Edicts, without exception, have force of law in the State, once they have been sanctioned by the Sovereign, & even in last resort, they must be abrogated; they have with regard to time, if an Edict has found no constitution with other Edicts, last resort force of Laws, & abrogated the first; because it would be the last known will of the Sovereign, & the only one able to act. Contradictory Edicts abrogate each other reciprocally in the Laws, which have been conformably remitted vis by the Laws. If this order has not yet been executed, unless by prejudice.

All Edicts, without exception, have force of law in the State, once they have been sanctioned by the Sovereign, & even in last resort, they must be abrogated by the Legislative, & cannot fall into disuse through the lapse of time, if an Edict has found no contradiction with other Edicts, last resort force of Laws, & abrogated the first; because it would be the last known will of the Sovereign, & the only one able to act. Contradictory Edicts abrogate each other reciprocally by the Laws, which have been conformably remitted vis by the Laws. All this has not yet made any contradiction nor reclamation; & which are not yet known nor that where it is marked that the State, & which has not derogated from always being in force of all the others; to which was given to it & the usurped without article 40 of the Edict of 1738, & of the following article.

Edict of 1788, which grants only a provisional tolerance for practice, awaiting the Code, on the expectation that there would soon be Laws contrary to the Edicts; & if none have been introduced into the Kingdom, the Parliament would judge, after their contraries; & that to enforce these Edicts which do not do so, it would never be Law, if they have not obtained; but it would let them judge, on all their good ones; one must observe them, as they will not have been Edicts introduced in form into the State, & of these particulars, they cease to be the good of the State & of these particulars, to particulars if they become bad; for if on one side the [terriens juridis] must be conformably followed, one must still poorly exercised, if the objects serve the force which were conferred to them to the goal which had judged to establish them; by virtue of this axiom of law, faisit populum jurare in jus. As this public good, when he wishes, it is no longer in use; but one must only say, it is no longer worthy of preference in abuse; & if it would not authorize preference or prescription, or if there were not concurrent bad preferences encountered or established by the Laws, & the Sovereign then the Parliament & the Sovereign cannot abrogate these Laws or these customs established by the Sovereign; because the Sovereign is not new Laws to himself; as he is not contrary to himself, he can make a changing usage, or an ordinary state of the fallible; he can make some change in the execution, & although he does not encounter all knowledge & that his constitution of the State of Sovereign; which would make some strange be nevertheless sovereign through some strange misrecognition of the Laws of the Sovereign; or to let them be encountered in term, & if through usages [conérolution]; the Laws can never fall into disuse with the lapse of time, nor through contrary continuous usages; they subsist in themselves entirely, as long as they have not been abrogated. If it were otherwise, it would be necessary to prevent disuse, & preserve the Law of the Republic, that there be a changing usage or renewed every year the [gréberau] of the Small Council in General Council, & then deposited by Magistrates in all places susceptible of union.

It is true, that they can find Magistrates with due reason of Laws of the Sovereign, or to let them fall into oblivion; but if they let them be ignored, especially by what would do it, or not necessary interest; if they buy them or keep them in reserve; if they refuse to have them printed & known to the public; to give authority to usages which would be contrary to them; or if they neglect the truly sanctioned Laws, then they commit an offense against the Sovereign; put themselves in place, & thereby give rise to Law from usages which
