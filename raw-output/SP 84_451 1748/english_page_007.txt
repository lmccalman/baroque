Sacred Mystery

We have sought in vain for a
long succession of years to penetrate a
mystery which should remain eternally
hidden in the silence of the tombs.
There are secrets which are not
made for the earth. We have finally
understood that it was necessary to renounce our
research, and that in wanting too much
to delve deeply into certain things, one runs
the risk of losing oneself in a bottomless
abyss. Let us content ourselves with that
which Providence has been willing to
reveal to us, and let us not seek to
penetrate further into the mysteries
of nature and of grace.
