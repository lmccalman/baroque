My Lord Duke

I have nothing this post from France
or the Low Countries but what is contained in
the enclosed advices.—

Nothing has been hitherto published
in this country with relation to opening the
trade with France but what the Admiralty
of Amsterdam has notified to the Merchants that
they were at liberty to load corn & for France
and other places; when a further explanation
has been desired by some of the Merchants they
have been told that the ships thus loaded are
on no side till notice is given to the Admiralty
and then proper convoyers must be provided there
to pass up those cargoes are for French account.
