that the Officers of the Farms, it is
Mr Dieuvé who succeeds him.

It is said that Mr d'Harcoulay, Keeper
of the Royal Treasury, is preparing to

Among other Matters which are
in question in a new
Ordinance concerning the
Bodyguards of the King, it is
that henceforth one will take
Two Brigade Chiefs from the
Cavalry, and Two others from the
Corps, whenever these Positions
are vacant, consequently
the last Promotion of General
Officers having caused some
to become vacant, the King has chosen
to fill Four of them, Messieurs
de Lillereau, de Salebene, d'Ettignat,
and de Pontmartin.
