consequently the binding [Juinimens] binding, that he reproaches us to the
revolted Provinces and affects the recognition
that one had had confidence in these examples:
that the Provinces ranged with the [Molasses];
had been cured by the time of the New Grain.
This Response has somewhat satisfied the Minister
of finances, who no doubt has Projects
to have the Grain affirmed also in order to
have it opened by the viscount; in the
Warehouses of the Municipalities.
     The Parliamentary Almanac at Besançon
has ended that of the Marquisates of Grain;
and has had Municipalities come that
one had passed, for [Loÿné]; upon leaving
that Bread, which sold for 5 Sols per Pound,
has fallen all at once to 2 Sols.
     One speaks to me here only of Violences, of
frequent Thefts and Assassinations;
one has already made an example at Dieppe in
the past Week. If this continues,
we must fortify the Watch before
[Eliser] and survey the Woods in favor
at his place. Misery is tyrannical; there are
so many Servants in ambition. There
are Workers without work, that this furnishes
these thieves, too many who are in need.
