We invite the Geometers, who went there for
a Course of Observations with the Steward of the
King's Houses.

The Queen of Catherine all the [Lainement];
The King of France Leffleuska has arrived
in Paris, coming from Quebec; and has
entered the Chamber to render his
homages.

The Magistrate, and the Monarch are ready
to give order for Those, and the Triumvirate
has Order to judge at Chalice without falling
to Catherine, and the two Principal
[Surnommés] have Order to embark
his Pieces and Cannons at St Livres de Belles,
and Rural Mode.

We like to Nourish to dishonor some
Cannonballs, and we work in the town on the
Construction of the Vessel and the [Tragite]
for the future born, and we hope that it will
allow them to leave in the Month of March
next.

We support the Brigade of St Theodore;
we have added the [Tonelles] to serve as
[Tortembarquement] with the Geometers
and O Supplies.
