The Nomination of Louis XV and State Councillor
d'Epernon has made necessary in turn the
Accountants; Denis and the king strongly not
confirmed.

Mr. Turgé prepared last Friday
to go take the evening hour
at Versailles and at the Dauphine's after
Council. He came to see last
the King, upon leaving his [Mairie] and
The Minister who assures that his Majesty
regrets it, she will arrive Tuesday evening;
The [Mle] King regrets it very much for
and his son whom Croy also regrets equally
by whom the not.

The Queen is quite in place, a Miss of the
Mathematicians at Orleans: of me by
[Plaintis], she should go to Brittany,
in Estates to be quite considerably,
to give herself views of Mathematicians at
Paris increased, in open same,
that she will double at Versailles for
the [Corpée].

The King wanted to double 60 Thousand
Livres of salary in [centre] of the
Songs for fine manuscript of prayers,
but [liels] has very finely the fact.
