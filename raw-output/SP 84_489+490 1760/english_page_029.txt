Whitehall October 7th 1760

Dear General Yorke

Sir
I have received the
favour of Your several
letters of the 30th: by Sr
& the 3d: Instant by the
Post, & of the 4th: by
Express, all which were
immediately laid before
the King. I am sure
it is unnecessary to say
any thing to you to
quicken Your Attention
in sending in the most
expeditious Manner
possible, whatever comes
to your Knowledge in
the present very
interesting & critical
moment. I am
desirous to desire You
would punctually
transmit to the Hereditary
Prince whatever
Intelligence You can
procure of the Motions
