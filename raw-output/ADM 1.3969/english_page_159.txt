It is reported from Rheims
that the Engineers and the Academicians
charged by the Government to
take Cognizance of the Works
to be done, to dig navigable
Canals in this Province;
appear to agree unanimously
that there is for a Canal from
Châlons to St. Malo, by the Made-
leine, [qu'il est et trois avis d'avis

will not go beyond 600. Thousand livres.
Consequently the States have decided

Denier-ou.

Despite the advanced Works
of Cherbourg, the Engineers and the
Academicians, according to the Wish of the States,
come to St. Malo to install it

port for the Royal Navy.
