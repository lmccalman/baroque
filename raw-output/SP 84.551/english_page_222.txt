Cadiz, with troops; & that
several other Vessels were
near the First Order.
   I return from the execution of the
Projects, having departed from Alicée in the
night from Saturday to Sunday last,
to join his Envoy who took
the King at St Defonse, in a
hired Coach, & having
loaded three Chests there, of which one was
filled with Papers & the other with Effects,
& the other with Piety & a Purse of Ecus
which he was concerned about, & that the Chest of
Papers was no longer there; which
obliges him to return here
to make Searches for it.
He will give Notice of it by an Express
to the Envoy; but until now He
foresees that all his Searches
have been useless.
