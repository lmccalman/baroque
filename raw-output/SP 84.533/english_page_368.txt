Geneva the 30th November 1775.

You were kind enough
to receive from the printing house an authentic
Copy of what took place
concerning the horrible Attack made by
the Duke en Grey of Poland; and which
accords with what the public
Gazettes have already told us of it.

My Friends from France assure
always, that if Peace is not made
here soon between Prussia and
the Porte, that there is the appearance of a
more General war next Spring.

I am also written that the Courts of
Petersburg, of London, of Berlin,
of Stockholm, and of Copenhagen,
have made, or are occupied in making
an Offensive and Defensive Alliance,
in which some Places have been left
for the States-
General of the United Provinces to enter;
but until now these Republicans
seem concerned for Neutrality.
