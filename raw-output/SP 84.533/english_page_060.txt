N° 60.

                                          Brest the 27th July 1775.

                                                    There is no question
here of any Armament, they are sending one
of 2 Small [Petites] of the King to proclaim for the Peace
of France.
         The chevalier d'Haute feuille is leaving
the Navy, to be made Lieutenant-
Colonel of the Normandy Regiment,
and to be made Colonel when his brother
is named Field Marshal.
         Mr de la Boëssiere who had [constitué]
himself Prisoner here, was summoned to the Court, he
was very poorly received there by the Minister,
this appears to be taking a bad
turn, undoubtedly Mr de Boëssiere
[s'escuse] against him.
         The Affair of Mr Galaret, who let
his Ship be lost at Isle de France,
and whom the 2nd [Relâche foursi], was badly
handled also; he is said exiled on the point of
being so. - Mr de Bompart who finds himself
at Versailles is against him.
         Several Crosses
of St Louis have just been distributed in this Department; people
were upset that Mr de Broves was not
recommended [for] his Squadron which went to
                                                    Tunis,
