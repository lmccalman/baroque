The Dearness of Provisions of all kind,
is felt highly, there that in the usual Stand of the
Generality, begins to give us in several Towns
of this Province the Symptoms of Commotion.

The Scarcity, however of Corn in several
Countries, and the great Demand that there is
for other Countries, particularly for France,
begins to alarm the People; and if by any
Violence they should oppose the Exports, as
it will most likely bring on a Famine so
is the Prospect only of the Exportation that
brings Plenty here.

In France, particularly in Normandy and
Brittany, the Harvest has totally failed;
and there, as well as at Port and
Amsterdam, very extravagant Commissions for
Corn to supply the Capitals.

In some of the Provinces of France particularly
in Brittany, the Ground was so impregnated
with Water, that they were threatened with
Losing, the Season for Sowing.

I have the Honour to be most Respectfully,

My Lord
            Your Lordships
                    most Obedient, and
                        most Obedient Servant,

                                        R.W. Ottery.
