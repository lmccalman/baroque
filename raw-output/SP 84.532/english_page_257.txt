We have had these

past days a very strong gale, that
the Rolland of 64 Cannons, which [fatté]
[lavié] to the water, was stopped under the
[Celle] by the St. [Jeglaze] there
considerable water entered there.
It was for the best.

The Alexandre will be launched to Water
to take to Morlaix these two Vessels
are constructed by Mr. Olivier

The Court has not yet given any
Orders relating to Peace; but
always go their course.

alone can give some
Consideration to this Corps.
