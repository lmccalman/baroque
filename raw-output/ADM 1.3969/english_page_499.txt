The St. Genous, and 8 Thousand Quintals
Old. All these Vessels have
been constructed since the Month of
July last.
    A Number of Vessels are to be
completed imminently; but the
Government has stopped them, to
serve a [Refine] of the [Pellelier];
although we still have a good
number of Vessels without being
able to use them for the present,
for we are constrained to
take Foreign Vessels
in our Ports, to join them
to our [Eslaves], to go to Egypt
against the Moors, who are very
enraged against the Spaniards.
