                    Rotterdam this 3rd September 1778.

Sir

            I have indeed received today
my ordinary Packet from Paris,
but the Correspondent has forgotten,
or neglected to put in it the Dispatch,
which I knew as an Accident
that can happen. But what
intrigues me, is that I have nothing
nothing from the Second Correspondent,
since the Packet from Paris
is officially missing today.
I shall wait for the next Ordinary,
to see if there comes one,
if I had any Information.
            I have the honour to be
                        Sir

                    Your very humble and
                    very Obedient Servant
                                        M. Wolters


Philip Stephens Esq M.P.
