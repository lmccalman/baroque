R. the 10 L. 1842.

Paris January 3, 1776.

Our letters from Brest
speak only of the Vergugon & the Indien,
which are being put in condition for the Indies.

It is reported from Toulon, that there
should be armed next Spring an
Evolution Squadron, composed of
12 Ships of the Line. It is added,
that one of the Officers is missing and
many Corsican Gunners
in the furnished Troop.

Our Letters from Brest say,
that the Count of Marigny is 100
hours away from the great Illness;
but that it must be will permit him
to recover entirely. The Chevalier
Lundi is very tranquil there. He is
the chief leader of the Bandits who were sentenced
to arrests upon disembarking at
Cayenne. He knows with the Agreement
of the King of Sardinia, which does not
frighten those who, like him,
would have the desire to revolt.

On.
