4 January No 2

Paris, October 22, 1780.

Letters from Toulon
from yesterday announce nothing new;
no orders are requested for
armaments.

However, according to what one reads in the
Gazette, there must be something
prepared for war; more timber
requested for Bordeaux; the one
from Bordeaux has left for that City,
but there is still some difficulty with
the embarkation of those from la Ciotat destined
for the same Destination.

Letters have arrived at Court most
recently from Madrid, and one receives from the English.
A Council meeting was held in the evening at
the king's on the occasion of this news, which
has not transpired. Meanwhile, the
Spaniards are quartering at Brest.

One still speaks of Projects of
[fourures]; the one which appears most
likely to become serious, is The
Château of the Ballets of [Comfluence]; or
the forest of St Valerie, with Château
of Plessis, which neighbor it, form
a place for Commerce. One must await
the Result and the Will of the Parlements
to see many things.
