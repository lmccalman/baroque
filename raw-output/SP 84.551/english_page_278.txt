Madrid the 2nd September 1776.

My letters from Cadiz
of the 20th August, announce to me the
Landing of M. de Fayolles,
who found nothing ready for
his Expedition.

That they had embarked for
the Indies of Vera-Cruz the Duke of Aumale
of 1777, the Monarch, for
Puerto Rico, without knowing for
what Destination; and that the
Captain of said Vessel
had sealed Orders,
which he was not to open until
a certain Latitude.

From Cartagena, dated the
24th April, I am informed, that
they were dispatching with haste the
[Valonne] of Rio de l'Achenta, of
20. Cannons, for Cadiz.
