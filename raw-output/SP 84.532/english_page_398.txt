N° 28

                                                      Paris April 5, 1771.

        The Letters from Vincennes
of the 28th say, that D. Hore sent to Weyprecht
of whom we have already spoken, is the only Missionary
of the Port, but that several Persons of consideration
[disjointent] to embark with Mourelle.
        These are the Rumors of the 27th that D. Pedro de Mesa
communicated by M. de Chavailles, who had
told M. Hore, that Mourelle had reserved himself
to go finally to carry to our Colonies some
Relations of the Peace. This is the only
News from this Port, where all Papers of the
Merchants of Paris and of Holland
are that Villages of Prud'homme and Renauld
will remain from here; [touquelles] one continues
only the [lourinde] commanding in
Weyframa.
        There is at Brielle no vessel followed
from Holland nor [battoit] so much nor from where with
other merchant vessels in [desiree] good
to be [Loues] en route.
        I advise you, that the King has well appointed
for a Place of President of the archives
at Basel with said, that M. de Montagues be
with some [informates] months, but that we
find at Montesson, in Council of State,
that by Means of the Office [seqles], which are done
[cafe] for having done what is necessary.
                                                                                                          Ce
