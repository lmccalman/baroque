Madrid February 10, 1773.

Monsieur Moreno informs me of
his arrival here, [munis] to Marquis des
Grimaldo the Letter from the Minister of
[Logeyres], to learn of the Conditions
that are judged suitable, and the Guards
are to his [justes] children. [Mon] him
subsequently that the letters of new
bills of exchange will have the power
to be renewed; [exorte] that he finds
himself now unable to exercise
his functions, until he requests
a Passport for the city of the
Jurisdiction of office.

I am informed from [Caprice], that
all the troops in Garrison in
these Environs, have received Orders to
return to their different
Garrisons, and that the
Provençal Grenadiers and other Militias
await the return of the two
Guards, whom they have just sent
to execute the said orders.

With regard to the Navy,
there was at sea no vessel,
although everything remained in the
same
