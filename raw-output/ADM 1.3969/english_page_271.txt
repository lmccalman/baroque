of the Consternation in which he finds himself, and
of the unfortunate [justes] that this
Operation cannot fail to bring about.
     It is reported from Catalonia, that
nearly all those there find themselves [impuritée]
by Casonna & Higer who with 10 to 12
Xebecs and Galliots, had already taken
several Vessels. The Courier of
Majorca; large Xebec of 30 Cannons,
was obliged to return to
Port, for fear of these Pirates.
     It has been learned from Ferrol, that
there had arrived from Cadiz a Convoy
of other Vessels ready, for a
[Commission portée]; which is supposed
to be destined for Peru; all the
more so, since by Order of the Court
they are embarking at the same
Time in Cadiz, the Two Regiments
of Infantry of Naples, and of
Seville, for America.
