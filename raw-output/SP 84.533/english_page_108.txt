The Reforms in the Troops, of which
we have spoken, took place, but the
men were kept, they were only made
to change Flags. The Troops were reconstructed
entirely in the Spirit which had
composed the Militias of the Kingdom,
to which were adopted the Grenadiers of the
Troops, the 18 Battalions which were disbanded from
these new Regiments became Line
in time of War, the Colonels disposed
of the Posts as in the other
Regiments. The 44 Colonels of the
Grenadiers of France since 1758 each
had one of these Regiments which
became in time of Peace, Royal Battalions
which were disbanded.
These Country Governments had
30 Thousand Men of regular Troops
more; they cost less
than before.
The Grenadiers of France have Orders to be
assembled on the 10th of this Month at Rouen.
We have not the slightest News
of [Mor], all is tranquil everywhere.
