Consequently we don't yet have News
from Rome nor from Corsica. For the Weeks
that it has been raining almost continuously, all
the Rivers are overflowed, and carry away
all Communications for the Couriers.
   It is reported from Rennes, that the Parliament
is continually assembled on the affair
of Messieurs de la Chalotais; it appears
that the Remonstrances will not be
brought to the King, and that the Court will
not be able to prevent the Procedure.
but the Ministry is free to guide
the two Procureurs Generaux, being
always returned to Saintes by a
Lettre de Cachet. The Affairs appear
as confused as ever in
Brittany.
   It appears good that there is a Commission
named to judge Ballaud, [Bauf] of Appeal
to the Grand Chambre. The office of Treasurer
of the Police is granted to Mr. [un Alleure],
[Frelle] of Treasurer of the Marechausées
to Mr. de la Chapelle, [Commissis] of the
Bureau of War.
