My Lord Duke

The enclosed paper was given me
by mr De Rath the King of Poland's Secretary
at the Hague, and I thought it of very great
to be transmitted to your Grace.

If your Grace thinks his embassy worth
while, mr John Dick who goes to England ye
next tuesday, Wensday, or thursday, and to whome I
have communicated the same will receive

your Grace's commands upon it.

I have the honour to be most respectfully

My Lord Duke -

your Grace's
most humble & most
Obedient Servant
R. Wolters

His Grace the Duke of Newcastle.
