to encounter a Ship, and Two
frigates flying Maltese Flag,
which a cannon shot had forced
to strike, and that being from the Porte,
this small Squadron raised white
Flag. The Commander
questioned the Captain Heaune about
whether in Peace and whether in War, if
there were in this Sea any
French, Spanish,
English, or Russian Ships; if one employs
in France, if there was need for
War? This gives rise to
much Reasoning;
one could not know of what Nation
are these three Vessels, and their
Project, in cruising through these Waters
The general Opinion is, that These
are Russians, in Alliance with
the English.
