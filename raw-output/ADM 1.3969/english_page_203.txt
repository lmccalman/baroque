The News from Sardinia all
agree that the King is increasing
his Army; and that he has given
the most pressing Orders on this Subject.

The Letters from Madrid of the
8th of the Current month report that according
to the News from Cartagena, Mr. Earnell
was before Oran on the 26th of last month.
It is added that the Departure of the Division
of Don Querres has given rise to
much Conjecture, as
several said that he was bound for
Livorno, Genoa or Civere, however
it is assured that he has gone to disarm
at Ferrol.

One still awaits
the famous War Council to
judge the Affair of the 11th of April
