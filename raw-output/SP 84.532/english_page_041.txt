They write to me from Cartagena, that the
triomphants arrived there from Naples,
and that after some Repairs
it would go to join the Squadron of Cadiz.
At the harbor they continue to reinforce and
arm Don Raggio's Squadron, that
the abundance of Sailors there is so
great, that they had sent away
nearly 6000 until further Order

It is counted that in all Spain
can assemble 42 Thousand Sailors
in a State to Serve.

Several Private individuals have offered
in Case of need, to equip at
their Account 8 Ships of War.
