They are gathering concerning the general Movements
that are taking place in this Port,
they are working generally on
all the Vessels, they are masting them,
they are repairing them, they are careening them,
Workers are arriving to us from all Parts
and of all Kinds;
they are making work even up to the
Ropery.

I take advantage here to certify, that
the Commander of the Navy
will be charged with all the operations
of the Port, and that consequently the
officers of the Port and of the Administration
will no longer form the orders, with the
military ranks. The general Arrangements
for the Navy, have
decided it, they will be expected shortly
and they assure that everyone
will be satisfied with it.

They announce to us as Intendant
Mr. de la Porte, Ordonnateur at
Bordeaux.
