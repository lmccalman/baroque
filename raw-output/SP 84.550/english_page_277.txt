N°. 16.

Toulon the 25th May 1776.

They began
the Refitting of the Unifiant on the 20th of this;
there was very little wrong, but
the more one examines it, the more one
finds it rotten and in bad
condition; there will be for three Months
at least to work.

They will begin Tomorrow, the
Refitting of Caesar, and another.
But they fear, that this Refitting
will not be considerable.

The Frigate l'Aimable, will be
[bordée] entirely with [Ardeusiers].

They [lernette] l'Éclaire, another fri-
gate next Tuesday, and the
improvements that one [feut] on Wednesday.

They found the Jardins in good
Condition, in [quales] nevertheless loses the
[Couruch].

Everything bearing, very very well
