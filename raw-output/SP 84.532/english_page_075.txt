We are still in anxiety
to learn of the Nomination of a new
Minister for our Marine, it is much to be
hoped that the Stability of Ministers
there will be as great as that
    We are at best for a Commander
and for an Intendant; the latter has the fire to
make us pay, and lends to all that
can give Pleasure to the Corps.
