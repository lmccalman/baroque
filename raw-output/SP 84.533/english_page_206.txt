nothing would prevent me from arriving from those
Quarters there. If I receive a letter from there
in two or three Posts from now,
I will return to know the cause of
this delay.

I have the Honour to be with a profound
Respect

My Lord.


                    Your very humble &
                    very Obedient Servant
                         M. Wolters.
