Our Council of 25,
received Dispatches from Vienna, by
which Sire & they convey the
5 April of 60, which arrived the 22
April, which was the day of the Renewal
of the alliance against the Most
Christian Majesty, and the thirteen Cantons,
we are invited to accede to it;
one of the principal Conditions
that France asks of us,
is, it is said, a Company of
Genevans of One Hundred Men, which
would be maintained by France, but
which we must recruit at our
expense. Their Excellencies of
Bern congratulate us on this
Consideration of the Views of France,
which when we will be in agreement
on the Conditions, This treaty must be
guaranteed, by the General Council of
Citizens and Bourgeois.
