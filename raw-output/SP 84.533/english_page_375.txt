to My Presidents de Mortier, de Chateau, provin:
and de la Bourdonnais had Audience with the
King, and then requested Audience at the Council
presented to his Majesty by the Ministers of the
Parliament concerning the Edicts, the King responded
that he would have them examined and Good Council the third,
and that they would have to await his Response.
The Deputies announced at the Chancellor's, and to the
Four Ministers of the Departments they
gave his Response, bearing his obstance:
That the various Engagements, and the pressing
Needs of the State would not permit them to
retract anything else from the Edicts, except the
Rights which had precedence over the Octroys,
and will be no less established nor the all,
and that response would be given to the other pretensions
of the returned Deputies, and the previously being
assembled Wednesday, the first President
gave Account of the Mission and of the Response
of his Majesty, of which it was ordered that it
would be Registered, and that notwithstanding
one would still await Remonstrances to the
Regist, but all this was so day of
Remonstrance, the Parliament 18th that one would manage
to all perhaps the Spirits to attempt the
which work is very of the most time simple
