Rott: Dammbon 28th 1782.

My Lord-

I had the honor to inform your Lordship
by the last post that Forbes was returned from
Embden, and that I suspected that he was to go
to England with the mail of the 29. instant; but
I have since been informed that Forbes finding that
he can not safely go to England, and that Harris,
a young person who was said formerly an officer
in the Spanish Service, and a young Swede, who
all three came with Forbes from Embden, were
over in the last Pacquet Boat for Harwich.
Their chief errand is by procure Subscribers
for the New Company of trade to be erected at
Embden, and to purchase a Ship for the Sd
Company: their point is not from the King of
Prussia himself, but from the Asiatic Company
