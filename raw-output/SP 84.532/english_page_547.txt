People express contentment with the Administration
of the Chevalier des Roches, our Governor;
but there is much Discord among
the Officers; one does not pay, everything is
expensive, that does not put [people] in good Spirits.

The English frigate which carried the
English Commissioners to the Coromandel
Coast, with Powers
to change the Administration, must
be captured, for since a Year that it
departed from the Cape, one has not learned
of its Arrival anywhere.
