Warshale August 8th 1764

Sir,

You will receive herewith
inclosed a Copy of an Order in
Council, for preventing the
Illicit Trade carried on at the
Isle of Man, and as it has been
represented, that Branches in
foreign Countries have been
concerned in this Trade, the
Mty has judged proper to direct
all his Ministers to give Notice
where they reside, of his intention
in this behalf, to the end that
those, who have been hitherto
concerned in this Trade, may
abstain from the future
prosecution of it, & may have
no pretence to complain, if
they should suffer hereafter
by the execution of the Laws.
It is therefore his Majtys
pleasure, that you should
communicate this Order
within
