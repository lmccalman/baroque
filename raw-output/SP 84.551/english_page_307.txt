whose intention was just, it well
seen, but whose execution was poorly
and too hastily carried out,
because the honest Minister
was weak, and pushed by a
fanatical, ambitious Sect, inclined to
see the End. The monstrous She of these
People awakens through the favor of some
happy Innovations, which had
been indicated to the Government
before the First of the Economists
was in the World. I will overturn,
without the Nation finding
Advantage in it, and even after
a number of Families have suffered
Losses, Disruptions from which
they have never recovered:
and that the Monarch has made in
[Plambules] and Discourses, a
vain display of Spirit and Sentiments
of Benefaction. It is the Lack of [Perfumes]
which has not been the least of the Motives
that caused the [Bureandes] to be established,
because that will bring about some
Mozart.
