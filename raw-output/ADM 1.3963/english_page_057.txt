The Council of State meets for a good hour,
in order not to have too much to tell me:
to work more calmly.

This Ministry may have
Deputies in Vienna, & in [Colonnmais]
for the old ones, to
make some changes there

The King will not appoint any 1st
to the vacant Governments & to
[vegrier], all ten being
by classes, to be given
as Reward to General
Officers who will have served.

The Command of
Upper and Lower Auvergne
is given to the Marquis de
Montboissier, without Salary,
but he has 20 Thousand livres in
Pensions, reversible on the head
of his wife.
