My Lord Duke

[Several lines of faded/illegible text]

I have no further news about the re-
volts at Surinam, the ships mentioned
in my last came over from thence, & we then
ship that has brought us the news is a general's
thought that the Revolt is not general, and as
there was just, but if much excitement in
the Road, it is hoped that the letters, handed
the governor.

His grace the Duke of Newcastle will be
this day at Boroughgrave, tomorrow at
Warlyck, and on sunday at the Hague.

The Commissioners for verifying the priamens
                                                 of
His grace the Duke of Bedford.
