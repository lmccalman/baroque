The Queen having given, as has been said,
to M. de Maillebois the Administration
of the Engineering, the Artillery, the Troops, and
the Fortifications, the Marshals of
France reformed [Louvois dernier], have,
[contre qu'il levait] made a Memoir to the
King, with the aim of representing to H.M. that it
was not fitting that the General Control
of Maillebois had been accorded these
functions [envers] the Marshal d'Estrées;
that an [Enseygneme Colonelle] had
rendered at that time a Sentence,
which declared M. de Maillebois incapable
of possessing in the future any charge
in the State, nor in the Military,
that one [envisoit] in this Sentence the
Armies, and the camps; that it is to him alone
[des places qu'il avoit pû il y avoit]
been named at the request of the
Marshals of France. M. de said, that
[les qu'ils avoient] recalled the Count of
Maillebois near her Person, and
that she found him worthy of her Confidence.
He fully justified himself

The affair remained there.

                                                 End.
