Brest the 22nd December 1770.

Our Vessels will
always provide them while waiting for
the 2nd Battalion of Normandy of which
Ollivier has the Seine, they will set
Sail any day tomorrow.
They are embarking the Second Battalion
of Artois by the large Merchant
Vessels, and will go the Jupiter
the Pere and the Belle Poule.
They are embarking for Monseigneur the
Second Battalion of the Royal
Vaissance Regiment on various large
Merchant Vessels also.
The Destination is not [des Hosteres],
We are always in
waiting for Peace or
war, the latter appears
inevitable.

Havre.
