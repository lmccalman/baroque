that he was one of these Men, and
Never for Mr. the Chever d'Amecourt,
former Counselor to Parliament,

always in the good graces of the
King, and continues to cut through and
you see him in the Departments;
the list of the Discontented is not
small, however I do not presume,
like most people, that the
Reign of this Minister will take very
soon end and water, although he has suffered
much, and that we still need
a Ministerial Revolution, but
only, to restore us
to Equilibrium.
