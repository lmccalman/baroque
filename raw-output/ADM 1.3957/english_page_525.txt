Merchant ships to serve the
Ships of Union, and the Frigates the Seine,
to carry the Regiment of Auxois
to Martinique, and to bring back Bazin
who has been there for a long time.

No Marine troops are being
embarked on the Union and the Seine,
the Passengers forming the Service in the meantime
and training to make themselves useful
for the rest in the Hold.

The Belle Poule and the Zéphirs are
working on the arming of the Union,

expected from Normandy.

Rouen to Le Havre, we have
however here who do nothing.

We continue to put all the

Planks for the
                                        beginnings
