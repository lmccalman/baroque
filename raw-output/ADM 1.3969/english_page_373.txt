18.7.29


                    Paris the 25th June 1824.

                         Last week
there was a treaty concluded between
France and Sweden for
certain arrangements suitable
to the two powers. It is assured
by this particular treaty that
Sweden gives us the Port of Gothenburg
to build vessels there, and
that we give to Sweden
the Isle St. Marguerite in the Antilles.

         There is still talk of the alliance
between the Emperor Russia,
England, and Denmark,
and one opposes to this alliance an
equally formidable one between France,
Spain, Prussia, Sweden,
Sardinia, Naples, and Holland.
Time will teach us what will come of it.
