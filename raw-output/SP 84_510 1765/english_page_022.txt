The Dutch Master adds, that the
People at Aberdeen tell him, that if
his owner, who lives in this town, had
intended to represent the Fact to the
Collector at Newcastle, the Commander
of the Privateer attained Cognizance
of it, & by the which she had been a
Citizen of Holland was comprised
by Aberdeen in Messieurs William
Brooner and Company, who was
perhaps be able to give a more
exact Account of the Affair.

As the Fact is named to be done
by one of His Majesty's Officers, which
is not credible, I thought it the more
necessary to lay it before your Grace
that, if there may have been any
mistake in the Names, I may receive
your Grace's commands to discover it
in such a manner, as your Grace
may please to command me.

I have the honour to be most
Respectfully
My Lord Duke
                           your Grace's
                           most humble, and
                           most obedient Servant
                                                R.W. Ottery.
