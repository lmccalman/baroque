Private letters

                                        Paris December 24, 1770:

                                        The day after the
great feast that the celebration of the peace of the Arts
caused, which was held at Versailles, the Duke of la
Vrilliere delivered a Letter de Cachet to
have a Commissioner arrested
d'Icaut, who had just received in
[retraittions] for his retirement to Bordeaux:
He was discharged with supposed Regrets,
which masked a secret
and direct Correspondence
with a Minister
of [esperieure] Foreign Power:
He went himself to the Bastille, and one
does not know what his fate will be.

Letters from Brittany which are
from the 3rd & 4th of the month from la Manche say that it
seems that one only waits for
the signal to put everything into execution,
and one expects from day to day the orders
to make the Embarkation of which
mention has been made, which is believed to be destined
for America.
