Madrid the 12 May 1782

It is reported from Aranjuez that there
are Projects as far as the eye can see for the Siege.

In the first place it appears that the
King and the Regency of Algiers are willing to
accept the Idea that the Court of France offers
to [vertrerer] them just as to the King
of Morocco, that they would have to endure
a furious Bombardment, which is being
prepared at Cartagena. From where we are
informed that Mr Barcelo, who is destined
to command this Expedition, had
arrived with all the Gunboats
and Bomb vessels, which have acted against
Gibraltar, being to be Supported by
several Frigates and Xebecs, and
three or Four Ships of the Line
there being no question of any landing.

In the second place, it appears that
following the Example of the Emperor, thought is given
here to the Suppression of Several
Convents of Religious.
