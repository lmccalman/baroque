Versailles the 24th August 1776.

You have seen, Sir, the
Decrees rendered, in execution
of the Edict of Disciplines, the Regulations made
since, and the Models, at the same time of the
parts an Account published to the Nation in
the name of its Minister, by the
declarations of the King, registered in the
Parlements, which established the usages and the
forms of the Accounts, for the instruction of
public men. It was not
possible to render the substance of it compromises
the respect of the King, and all the more so, that
to bring it closer, one had displayed fine
Sentiments, and fine Phrases,
but one has done one's best, and even
one has displayed there the Parlements, for
this Phrase. "We have believed moreover
to owe to give a particular attention
to the Representations of our Courts by
the Remonstrances which could weaken
the Dispositions and our Edict."
You feel, for the Contest the Privilege,
                                                     and
