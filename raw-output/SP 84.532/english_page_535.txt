since it was not without Difficulties in

     Here is an article to Settle, which imposes a
strong Obligation, but I find myself in
extreme difficulty. If my
Employees assure me of it, what
I must confess to having been in the
[tendlle onel] and occupied between
[l'ongonnre], the Emperor, the Prince, and the
France, concerning the Projects
and the Ports; that there is much to say that
concerns the Ready Projects, and that one
Shows therein finally some [Constorats]. What
[potendes loutle] can only be very
important, I promise, and even
give Assurance to my said Minister,
of a good Reward, if he could
procure for me a [fiscelle] Copy of the said
treaty. I will work on it from my Side,
I know the Thing very difficult, but if
it is not insurmountable,
perhaps I will succeed in it, in
which I ought all the more flatter myself,
that thereby one will see my Zeal and my
Activity.
