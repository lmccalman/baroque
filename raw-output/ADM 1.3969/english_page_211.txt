The Intrigues, and the Cabals which
reign among our Ministers,
appear to want to continue, especially
between those of the Indies, and of the

Persons constituted in Dignities,
General Officers, Viceroys, and
even Bishops are returning
from America, to Europe, as
Prisoners of State, the cause
is unknown.
