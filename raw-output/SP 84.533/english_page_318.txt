of Paris, received from the King net for
his office only 18 livres 14 Sols, today
that it is at nineteen, he will pay 2580 livres
of Rents, at the rate of 31,000 Livres,
[Préalation] of the Price of the Office, 25 of these
Rents will be paid by a farmer,
[accueillon] remains 500 livres of Subject,
which is 8550 livres entirely. But
18 livres 14 Sols. A President of Grenoble
receives only 5000 livres net of calculation
and pays today. The operation of
580,400 livres will be probably and the State of
to which it can reach 20,000 Livres [Longe]
