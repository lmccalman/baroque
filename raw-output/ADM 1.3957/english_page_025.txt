From the Isle of France
the 30th August 1769.

I will not stop to describe
to you the Situation, the Form and the Extent
of this Island, the Authors have spoken of it; 
but the Country is not as fortunate, near
its equator, as one would like to believe. The
Hurricanes, should be that they are not
really there, and make in the Red Sea, in
Comoro, in Segault, where one sees only
Paper, this means that the Country cannot
trade with India nor with China.

Four rivers [descelent] the Mountains:
the Locusts, the Rats, the Monkeys, and the
Segailles, small Birds that eat everything;
The Provisions there are of a horrible [chetté]:
The Things that come from India are
as expensive as in France; the Productions
of the Country are bad.. What is
best is the Coffee; the Poultry and
Game are worth nothing there,. The terrible
Heat makes everything there Without
Substance..
