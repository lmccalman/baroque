nature very Secrete, it will not be easy to
trace it at once, and what I know of it at
present is so general and so uncertain that I
can not venture to announce it, till I am more
perfectly informed, which I shall make it my
particular business to be.

I have the honour to be most respectfully

My Lord

Your Lordships
most humble and
most obedient Servant

R Wotten.
