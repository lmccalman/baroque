N° 43 bis

Paris, December 2, 1784.

The Emperor's Response is
still awaited, and the one which decided
the Preparations to assemble
the Army, was only from the last, at
[Vieillies]. The Certainty in which I am
that the Emperor has changed nothing in
his first Resolutions, and that he
effectively wants to make war on the
Dutch, has led our Court to determine
to give the necessary orders for a Campaign
of some the Emperor being firm
in his Resolutions, since neither the
Representations of the King, nor the Counsels
of his principal Ministers, and of the
most Generals have been able to induce him
to depart from anything.

The Activity of our Contractors
at Tournay will permit the Armies
to enter
