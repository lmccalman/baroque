Our Trade Treaty with the
Americans, is not yet concluded: They
They have made Eight Proposals, of which
Three have been refused, bearing
the ability to introduce into our maritime
Cities And Islands, where they are permitted to
bring Oxen, Sheep &c
&c, of course Poultry, all
sorts of Wood, &c. It is still [imbicile]
which will be permitted to them to bring
Cod there. It is not believed that They
can take in return our
Sugars; but indeed Molasses,
as in the past. Our Nephew
Allies will not be content with
these Restrictions; but we cannot
ruin our Commerce
and with it our Navy, for
their particular Interest.
