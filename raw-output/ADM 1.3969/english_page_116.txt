to give a Memoir for his justification
which is said to be very well done.

The Friends of M. de Bougainville
and Persons of the highest Rank,
have seen the Memoir of this
General Officer, it must be very
interesting, as much for the Reasons
as for the Ideas, and the Style.

When the Count de Grasse will be
permitted to make public his
justificatory Memoir, and the Grievances,
without doubt to hold the other Memoirs
of the Officers whom he accuses will
also be printed.
