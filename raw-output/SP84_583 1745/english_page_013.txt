You see the Importance, and thou I am fully persuaded
that this friends court has been duly acquainted, my
zeal would not permit me to let slip this opportunity
of giving you my thoughts, which are those of a
most zealous and faithfull subject and Servant to
his dear Majesty, and his family. -

I have told mr Western to my answer to his last that
I should be glad to know what I could allow my friend
for this correspondence, which I can not afford to keep up
at my own costs, which I must desire you to mention
to his grace, and when I have your answer you may
depend I shall engage what is allowed with great
fidelity. -

I was likewise of opinion that the giving a
reward to the preceptor of a governess allowance
at this juncture would be a infinite kindness. -
All the articles in the enclosed that are of a
maritime Nature I have proposed to the Admiralty;
but have yet to wait and have no time trouble to leave
the one copy to wait; for I shall continue in the
same way tell I have your answer to this.

I am -

                                                Sir -

10th July of 30th 1815                    your most humble &
     [?]                                      most obedient servant
                                             G.W. Watson
