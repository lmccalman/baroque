holds all in his power to maintain the Trading Ships,
could to his last breath protect and befriend. So that he
that he has already given proof of his true inclination
the Merchants, by the peace of the new Burgomaster
he would on any give till stronger proofs of the same regard
to the City Council several of his Principal Merchants, had
means made might always be duly protected: & and
promise we have all seen the effects the very next day in
Prince's nomination even five of the Deputies, charged out
Commission, have been appointed Councillors of this City.

H.S.H. was further pleased to assure us in his
friendly and strongest manner, that the Merchants of his
will always be admitted to speak to him, whether the
to come to him by a Deputation, or that any one should
come alone, adding these most favourable words, that he
will never begrudge the time which he passes in talking
with Merchants.

These, Gentlemen, are amongst many other
and favourable protestations of H.H. the most striking
which I have been able to keep in my memory, of which
it was July to make a Report to you, with our thankful
trust, which it has pleased you to put in us, in charging
this important Mission.
