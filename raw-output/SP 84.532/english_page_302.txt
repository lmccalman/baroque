Private Letter

Paris, March 2, 1795.

For several days,
Under the outgoing Ministry itself, that they were going to
renew the Members of the Commission
whose last years & activity
It is believed that the Chancellor's Object was to
negotiate with it, & to offer it provisionally
the best Propositions, to beg them to remain
until better ones could be put in place.
But scarcely, that the Dismissals they had just
suffered, & in their [attestement] for
Solemnly the Matters of which they
knew the Court of Aydes, and the
Chamber of Accounts, which is in question
to destroy.

The Correspondence is Numerous, On
those the Chancellor counts little; they will be
put in other Cities, & perhaps from
Paris, to subdivide the Members that one
could appoint. According to this News the Sieurs,
the Meeting must be formed from the 12th to the 13th
of March. However all that appears
extraordinary, and is contradictory
between that the project, that one cannot
complete in such a Crisis of
Complication.
