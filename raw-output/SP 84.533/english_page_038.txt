Paris the 2nd July 1793.

The letters from our
Ports announce nothing. Those from Toulon
of the 30th June, speak only of the Rewards,
that have just been granted to the Officers
who were employed in the War of Louis;
M.ce Provaz is made Chief and Equerry,
in the army of the first Grand Carbon
Rouge, there are Pensions, and warrants
of St. Louis given even to the Gunners,
who have received a Month of their Pay
as Reward.

It is reported from Rio Janeiro, that there would
be the appearance of some incident;
that they are hastening to have manufactured the [Voute] of
Negroes, and transport them to our Colonies.

It is very decided, that the Minister of
the Navy returns to the Officers of this Corps
all the Positions that had been
distributed, both in Europe, and in
our Colonies.

There appears a Military Ordinance,
which states, there are Reforms in
all the infantry.

The 20 Million cut back in the
Expenditure, are destined to equip the
[Dettar].
