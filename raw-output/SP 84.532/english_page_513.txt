In some of these Writings, one goes to seek for the Parliaments
a chimerical origin, & one forgets the real titles of their grandeur to find for them others in a ridiculous & fabulous
antiquity. Soon one forms from them a power parallel to the sovereign power, & which, born with it, must serve as counterweight to it & be a necessary barrier between the King & his Peoples.
One travesties into a right of active resistance the duty imposed on
Magistrates to warn & to enlighten authority, finally by false

And this golden age, after which our Ancestors sighed?

the plot to misrecognize the authority of the King, & to overthrow by
the route of Justice from one extremity of the Kingdom to the other.
