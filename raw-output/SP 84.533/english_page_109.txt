Private letter

Paris August 22, 1778.

The little Swiss
dispatched for the two reverend Professors
from China, & which presented them returns to
the Isle de France, fortunately did not
meet them, which would have delayed the
distributions, and this comes from the fact that these gentlemen did not
wait for the time counting only on a
Benefice of [Cantipour Cant]. It is known that
Prince Preston is intercepted there for
much.
All the Letters received from the Isle by
these last Vessels, carry this same
sad Delay, the Isle first where we are
there, for lack of Subsistences, the private
Uniforms armed by Commerce not having
supplied the Deprivations of which the
ordinary Shipowners were neglected
to employ, and at a frequency such that the fevers
can officially sustain this
Defect
The [Prince] of this Month the New Parliament has
registered Letters Patent, by which
the King orders that it be Provided for the return
of.
