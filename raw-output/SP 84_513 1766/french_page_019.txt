Rotterdam the 2d April 1763.

My Lord Duke

I take the Liberty to send enclosed
to your Grace the Account of the Spanish
Correspondence & Draft for the Quarter
due the 1st of March last, amounting
to £116. 2s. Sterling, for the Receipt of
which Sum, namely £116. 2s Sterling, I
shall'd by the next Post take the Liberty
to draw upon William Davis Esqr of
the treasury at 25 Days Date.

As the year fixed for a Finale
of the Spanish Correspondence expires
the first of September next, and that
I stand engaged to give him Notice by
the beginning of June, that he may
regulate with the Brovins the Course to be
employed, I hope that in the Course
of next Month I may be honoured
with Your Grace's Pleasure upon this
Hedd.
