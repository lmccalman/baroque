From the Isle de France, January 20th

I suspect that here passes
the General Depot of France and its
Colonies, the Memoirs are brought in
Consequence to be presented to the Minis-
ter during his stay in France. -
This one will perhaps soon finish its
Commerce, and it will be a great good if this
Island stripped of wood, the Ministers is
[rafferma] there, one lacks this Family far
from the Streams of Madagascar, one is
obliged to send empties to the Cape of
Good Hope to have some.

The Carpenter had brought to the Isle
on the Louisiana the [chers] of Masts,
Commerce goes badly from all sides,
The territory was, they [s'étoffe] at the same
time the Peace, one works to repair it
but the thing never advances, when
one lacks everything, that will delay the
Departure until these three Months.

We have not the Good more than the
Clerks fled departed on Beauvais from Bengal
The Post establishes itself here as much as the
[mon la bon frail Descriptif], and to advance
little the good.
