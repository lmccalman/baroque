myself, the circumstances would not have been
near so much, had I not been obliged to have
a Person with me with Goods & pack creatures.
Yet in case I had gone to Spain and if
I am ever to be useful to Governor Dunmore
[always command me]

I cannot omit, in informing You, that
at least the greatest disturbances prevails among
the Hadereaugh and the Lower Creek, so
much that they publickly declare unless
some effectual remedy is immediately applied
& relieve their distresses, they will be no
longer restrained from every violence against
their Debters, At Invocal, Connegiale the
Tunes and Villages which I passed through,
they are in the same distress and appear very
poor & needy. I was anxious to know what
was doing at West Florida among every new
tract, passed through it, when I learned, that
never than the Traders forces should be
worth the attention of the Trad & after all the
they would prefer seeing them happy & well treated
amongst new lovers.
