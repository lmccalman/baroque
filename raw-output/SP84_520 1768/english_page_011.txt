Toulon the 10th May 1768

I have been sent from
Versailles by extraordinary Courier, who has
brought the Order to depart within 24 hours
for the Isle of Corsica the Regiments of Medoc,
d'Anhalt, & d'Artegne which are here, there was
a fourth which was la Reffuge, but they do not
believe them the Regiment of Orleans, about which I learn
that it matters that the Orders be
executed, & that the same Courier bring back word
of the Departure.

The [Dromes] of the officers for the Embarkation
of these Battalions at Toulon & at Marseille of the
[Indroites], do not permit us to remove ourselves from these
Places; Orders, we would cause to measure some
[Bermentations], time will tell us.

The Frigate la Pleyade arrived yesterday evening
from Candie, with approximately 15m.e 2 [chaloups]
which have been to depart, two others were brought
with the two [Verifianx] gone to our Brigade;
it is believed to enter that these [Varifianx] should
be carried to Constantinople, our man as
Ambassador, but it is learned that he will take
the Route by land.

Brest.
