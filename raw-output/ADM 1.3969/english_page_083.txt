N 24 May.

Paris the 9th May 1782.

One takes absolutely nothing interesting, neither at Court nor in the City.

The Officers of Note who must meet at St Martin to form the War Council by M. de Vigny, arrived there on the 29th of last Month.

One knows that M. de Vigny had not yet arrived then.

One only receives in our Sea Ports commercial Expeditions, for the Two Indies and America proper.

They write from Marseille on the 26th of last month among other Things, that the [Franneurs] of Convoy from Syria, Tunis and Cadix were entering the Port successively.

And that a Swedish Captain coming from Livorno, arriving there had a [Historique] Frigate, and Seven War Vessels.
