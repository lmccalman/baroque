Madrid 25. February 1773.

There is very little talk here
about the Conditions of Government
between this Court and that of London;
I am only assured that there is nothing
the Isle of Falkland. I persuade myself
that you will be better informed of this
affair than we; for there is talk here
a little very vaguely and in this regard.

Mister Harris arrived here
the day before yesterday, and awaits new
Letters of Credence to resume
functions at this Court.

They write to me from Ferrol, from Cartagena,
and from Cadiz, that everything still remains in
the same State, and that there is no
Order to disarm; but
only to suspend the
Continuations of Works, and
other Preparations for War;
it is also not a question of
making the troops march to
their different Garrisons.
