Madrid 2 December 1778.

A Courier arrived
from the Prince of Masseran on the 8th, was
dispatched again on the 9th, after the holding of the
first Council of this month.

Although nothing transpires from the
Council nor from the Dispatches, it is affirmed
that this Court has given the definitive
Responses. And that if the Court of
London does not want [any]. It will be
[intentée] and will decide it within
48 Hours, the War will be regarded
as declared. If this is so,
we will know in 36 or 40 Days what
[qu'en tion tenír].

The Preparations are not at all
slowed down, we continue as much to
embark Troops for
America, as to garrison our Coasts.

I am written from Cadiz, that the Squadron
Chief Marquis de Casti Bleij is
in this Port with a Squadron of 6
Vessels. That he must be reinforced
by several others, it is not known that he
is destined for Havana.
