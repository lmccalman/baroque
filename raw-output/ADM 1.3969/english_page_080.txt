Paris the 28th April 1783.

M. d'Estaing was at Versailles
Friday morning, and only returned
yesterday evening. He had several conferences
particularly with M. de Castries and M.
de Segur, as well as with that of Baron de
Breteuil, there is much talk of a change
in our Ministry.

It is assured that [messrs] last two
Marine officers, coming from outside
under escort, have been imprisoned in the Bastille.
As for M. de Vigny, he disappeared at the
moment they were going to [lire] conduct him to
Morlaix.

The people [disque] who claim to be friends
of England say today
that M. David Hartley was sent in order
to preferably have the commercial treaty
with Great Britain,
and the [Amiens] Subjects requesting your
Peace, that M. Conté must be the Friend of
M. Franklin, and had his Confidence.
