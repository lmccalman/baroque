Brest-the 05 January 1773

                The Order delivered
urgently our Batteries of the Port,
of the Gabelet and of the Roads; and the Order
given to suspend the March
of the Troops, is a Counter-order which
disrupts our Politicians.
    One flatters oneself of an upcoming Promotion
and that there will be 12 Squadron Chiefs.
    The Court decides nothing for the
[reçuisir] the Gloire and the Belle Poule,
still armed while awaiting
Instructions.
    Guisnes Vessels and Brigades,
are units.
    One does not doubt that the Union, and
the Seine have gone to the Isle
de France.
