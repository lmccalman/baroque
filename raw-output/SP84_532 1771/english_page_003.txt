I am surprised that you have not yet sent me
the papers that I asked you for. I beg you to
send them to me as soon as possible, for I have a pressing need for them.
I wrote to you some time ago on the subject of this
matter, and I have not yet received a response. I hope
that you have not forgotten me, and that you will
be so kind as to give me your news as soon as possible.

I learned with pleasure that you are well,
as well as all your family. I wish you the
continuation of this good health, and I beg you
to remind me to the memory of Madam your wife
and your children.

I greet you with all my heart, and am with
the most distinguished sentiments,
Sir,
Your very humble and very
obedient servant
