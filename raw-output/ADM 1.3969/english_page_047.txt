At the end of October, Mr. de Suffren
will have been in a position to set out again
with Him, because then He will have received
the Four Ships, which Mr. de Prinier brings
to Him.

It is said that five Ship Captains of
Mr. de Suffren, refused to fight,
and Three fought poorly, these
were dismasted. We lost
in this last Battle 82 Men
killed, and 288 wounded. Among the dead,
there are Two Ship Captains.

There is no mention of the Land
Army in India, except to
announce to us the Death of Mr. du Chemin
Lieutenant-General.
