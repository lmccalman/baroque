On September 18 Mr. de Suffren had
the Crews of the Vessels re-embarked.
On the 22nd, the English Squadron appeared, and
on the 23rd at Two O'clock the Combat began.
There were only three of our Vessels
that truly fought
within range, thus they were crushed.
The Héros lost its main Mast, the
small Topmast, the Foretopgallant mast,
and so many Men, of whom 30
died. After this Combat the Orient
of 74 Cannons, which had not
suffered in the Action, struck while
re-entering the Bay of Trincomalee
and it was damaged.

One is not without Concern
regarding the Situation of our affairs
in India.

The day before yesterday Mr. Pély de Fleury,
having given the Resignation of his
Position as Minister of Finances, the
King appointed the same Day, Mr.

D'Ormesson
