N° 64.

                                                    Paris April 2, 1778.

                                        The Letters from Brest
dated the 31st report, that Mr du
Chaffault's Squadron appeared the Day before 2 Leagues
from the Roadstead, that They contained 7 or
8 cruisers to convoy the Provisions.
There were moreover 3 men that one
could [à un Armement] in
this Port. The works are slowed down there,
although they continue to proceed
with the Repairs to be made to the
Vessels. The same thing is reported
from Toulon.
        It seems almost evident that it is
only the Duke of Noernois who has been in
Spain.
        The Marquis d'Ossun, who was
said to be dead in Madrid, is
not, and is even in
                                                much better health.
                                                                        They
