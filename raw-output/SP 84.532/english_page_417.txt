SPEECH

BY J. DE LA VACQUERIE;

First President of the Parliament of
Paris, to the Duke of Orleans, (later
Louis XII.) under the Reign
of King Charles VIII, in the year
1485.

PRINCE, we are the judges
of the people, & the King is ours:
We know no other tribunal
than the throne, & we have never
been the ministers of the ambition
of Princes, & the instruments of
the misfortunes of the fatherland. When
your King condemns you, what
subject would dare to judge you? Is it for
us to cast rash
looks upon the administration, we only
exceed the limits of our power,
when the Sovereign deigns
himself to push them back. Render
justice to the people, maintain

(23)

peace, obey the King, there is our
duty.

Extract
From the French
honor in the re-
ign of Char-
les VIII, vol.

EXTRACT

From a harangue made by HENRI
IV, to the People holding his Court of
Parliament of Paris, the 8th of Jan-
uary of the year M.D.LXXXXIX.

WHEN you would not veri-
fy the Edict, you will make me go to
Parliament; you will be ungrateful when
you have created this annoyance for me. Ne-
cessity made me make this Edict; through
youth nevertheless I made it,
made the soldier; at present we speak of it,
I did not make any pretense of it.
I am King now, & I speak as King;
I want to be obeyed. In truth, my
justice is my right arm, but if
gangrene is in my arm, the
left must cut it. When my
regiments serve me no more,
I disband them.
