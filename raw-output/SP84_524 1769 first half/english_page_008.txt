the four were either to live here
or to be Incorporated for the Province
this having Mr. Sealmius, who is now
him in the Dutch Office, and upon whom
naturally (he keeps the two offices combined)
the Result of my Deputy must fail, is a
year Must of no Application, and a
lack knowledge of the English Language
which he will take no Pains to learn
incapable of Succeeding him in our Town
and besides his Grace & Desire to push him
in the Magistracy, will make him less
governable, and out of the Reach of
Punishment in Case of Misbehaviour
All these Considerations have made me
wish to put some young Person under his
Training to be instructed by him, and
enabled capable of Succeeding him.
In this View I have cast my Eye upon
young Slake, a lad of great Hopes, and a
right Application and by my Care instructed
in the Languages &c.
I have applyed to the Prince of Orange
to try to procure to young Slake Power Constitution
She by providing the Letters with some
others alike.
