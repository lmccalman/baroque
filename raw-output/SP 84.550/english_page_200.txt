N°. 37.

                         Paris the 2nd May 1776.
                              Our Letters from
Julien of the 24th, speak only of
the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of
Chartres, of the festivities that
are given for Them; and of the contrary
Winds that have reigned for 10 or 15 days
contrary to the Departure of the Squadron.
     It is reported from Brest, that
despite Them they are working to find
the Means to force the Renommée,
[on devoit pour demiers d'expliquer,
l'attente de toute Monde de les
partir, et vous la remettre à fest];
this Vessel has much water.
     It has been said, that the troops of the Indies,
[resteraient l'annenir trois Menées,
de plus des hommes ehé qu'une],
which construct every Year, and that one
forces, the march: the King has named
three Marshals of France to
command them, 18 Lieutenant Generals,
and 36 Field Marshals. We do not
suppose ourselves made public.
