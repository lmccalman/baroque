The said Court persuaded that the Lord King
would punish the surprises made upon his religion if he
knew all the abuses which have resulted from them,
& that he would restore to the free exercise of their
functions the Magistrates who have been slandered
for having obeyed the Laws.

Has decreed that it shall be written to the said Lord King
in the most pressing & most
respectful terms, to obtain from his justice & from
his goodness the recall of the universality of the Mem-
bers of the Parliament of Paris, & the restitution
to the functions of their irremovable state, of which
they cannot be deprived arbitrarily, &
that there shall be sent within the day to His Majesty
a formal copy of the present Decree.

And whereas the rights of the different Orders
of Citizens are attacked; that the Princes &
Peers of the Kingdom are more interested than all
others in their conservation, by reason of the pre-
eminence of their state & dignity; & that the Court
is informed of the obstacles which have deprived the Parle-
ment of Paris of the happiness of being heard by the Lord
King; that he who presides over the said Parliament,
& who was charged with presenting to the said Lord
King its just & respectful Representations,

                                    11
has been without this removed from the Throne; & deprived
of all audience with His Majesty.

The said Court fearing, with all the more reason,
that its distance, that its present Decree &
its respectful Representations may not reach
the said Lord King, has decreed that for-
mal copies of the said Decree shall be sent
within the day to the said Princes & Peers in their
quality as Members of the said Court, & that the
Princes are requested, & the Peers invited, to em-
ploy their credit & good offices with the
said Lord King, to obtain the recall of the
Members of the Parliament of Paris.
