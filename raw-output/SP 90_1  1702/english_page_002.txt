Sir

[faded/illegible middle section]

I came the time last Saturday that I acquired
the reception of the letters that you did me
the honor of writing to me the 10th and the 13th of last
month because I only received them at the moment of
the Post's departure. It is with a very
great satisfaction that one learns here that things are
done in England [va cela fort beaucoup] to
encourage that for their honor had yesterday
morning after putting myself in [deute] in the manner
that you ordered me, to present to the King


to Mr. Secretary of State Simon
