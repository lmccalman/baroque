N° 52.

Paris the 24th June 1776.

Nothing has been received from
my Ports St. Jean that there has ever been
separation in Guadeloupe, more consequently
than that which is currently occurring;
one does not believe however in
war; but one will hold oneself ready for
any event.

The New Minister of Finances,
who knows the Navy, has just had
increased by 6. Millions per [Sezal]
and which is destined for the [Extraction]
of this department.

The Loan of 60. Millions
will take place, one takes the totality of the
Dutch to do it; there appear
for this Loan different Plans,
one does not know which of all will be
followed.

The Count of Maillebois is going
to be [projetté ennemi], and even the
Viscount [comptoir ser] the
Tribunal.
