Private                                Rotterdam 20 January 1783.

My Lord

     The Posts, and Boats, for Holland gave
notice that like this Day, are a Day use, if your
Lordship will be but able till yourself, if
they are worth mentioning to
     I have an account from Dover, it Day, it
must be owing to some Accident,
for I am pretty sure there can not be for
want of wind.
     The delays and great Price of the Posts
at Amsterdam upon an Express from
London to the Netherlands, and the
Letters from Paris this Day, makes
me give your Lordship information looked
upon as certain.
     We have this Day five Mails due from
England; and as there is no Packet Boat
to Helvoet, this Day being Sunday, the
delivery orders of the Post Office,
will be kept up to go together with that
of Friday next, unless a Packet Boat
arrives in the interim.
     I have the Honour to be most Respectfully
                                        My Lord
                                             Your Lordships
                                                  most Humble and
                                                       most Obedient Servant,
                                                            R. Wilson.

To the Duke of Dartmouth.
