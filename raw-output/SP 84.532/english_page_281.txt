No. 19.

Paris the 5th March 1791.

It is reported from Toulon
that there has been an Order to cease the works
of the Arsenal, and to dismiss all the
extraordinary Workers.

M. Fleuron Patenaude and M. Dejean, are
established in their Seat as Judges
at the criminal Court of Ardèches at Privas
and at Rochegude.

One has very fortunately occupied [oneself] in finding
Means to reestablish a Company
of the Indies.

Nothing interesting has passed, in
the Club of Jacobins, except that the Chancellor
came to make a Regulation, one
expects a good Law, of this Month, for
the Installation of the new Parliament:
When there was presented more People
than are needed to fill 50. Places,
there was disorder, one asks for
[une les nourrir une] Fountain of the
Chamber of the Old Parliament, to
form the Hall of the New; and here for that
Requisitions, one does not know if
will be able to establish them according to its [viande] Principle,
in that case one would introduce the Blanc of Lille
for the Parties at Court.
