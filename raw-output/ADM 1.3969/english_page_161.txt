On June 10th a new Earthquake
finished knocking down, and
engulfing in part, all that still remained
standing of all this unfortunate
City, and the Shocks were so strong
that the Inhabitants did not even
put themselves under Shelter from the Danger
in the midst of their Barracks
which they abandoned.

The second Courier from Naples will
give us the greatest Details
on the Effects of this terrible
calamity.

The Earthquake made made
itself felt also in Franche
Comté, and in Burgundy, but
principally in the Cities
of Dijon, Salins, Poligny, Beaune,
&c.

They write from Besançon on the 2nd of the
Current month, that on the 6th at 10 o'Clock in the morning
the air being calm and the Heat quite
strong, there was felt a Shock
of Earthquake, whose
Direction appeared to be from South to North
