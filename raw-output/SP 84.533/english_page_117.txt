Brussels the 29th April 1773.

There arrive from Day to
day in this City many French Officers
very recently reformed;
they take here Passports, and
leave for Germany, where they go
without doubt to seek fortune.

One works with a Diligence
of which one knows no Example,
in the Foundry of Malines, and
in that newly established
a quarter League from our City,
making Bombs, Shells,
Grenades, Cannonballs &c: which causes
much Speculation, and
Reasoning among our Politicians,
but from which one can draw nothing
with the least Certainty; there is
only time to unveil the
Mysteries.
