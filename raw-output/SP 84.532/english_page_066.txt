They came in good order from the Havres and
from Dunkirk, the provisions are
well enough supplied, but we are
missing some [Palvisons], there are not
enough to arm two Ships
because the Vessels that
bring them have put in. All
theirs are held here, but the foreign
Regiments are contrary,
it has been two Months since we have
seen the Sun.
La Bizanne and the Dauphin Royale
are still in the east, there is an order
to disarm them and their Crew.
And to keep them on their board,
ready to receive 6 Months of
Provisions.
