of this subsistence, Mr. Rigaud
d'Ogny, who can have his eye on it
within.

[La branche] de Goyse, Lieutenant
General, is named, it is said, to
command in Provence, in
place of the late Count of Rochechouart.

It is assured, that the [Equités] in
the Island of St. Domingo, are so
entangled between [Gous] of Spain
and that they remove from us the idea
of embarking, in that they
extend our Domination
by neutral Parishes, which
were in wasteland and the parish
remained in the Hands of the
Spaniards, of little use; but not
to the Contrary, to the Industry and
the Industry of our Colonists draw
the greatest profit, [quel] of the goods
and of the wood. It is thus that the Clergy
of news acquires a Clergy of
[spr] Mason, of which the news caused
because of the Contributions between the
two Kingdoms.
