Rotterdam this 16th July 1755

Sir,

At this moment Mr Stake comes here to communicate to me
the letter that you did him the honor
of writing to him the 12th of the current month by which
you tell him that Mr Chancellor Stones
had explained to him that certain salaries
would be continued, but that would be
taken by him or by some other person
authorized to pay them
in the conversation that I had the honor
of having at The Hague on this subject with His
Excellency, he did not speak to me at all of
this arrangement, and simply told me
that I could be assured, that my
salary, and that of Messrs Stake, father
and son, would be continued on the same footing
