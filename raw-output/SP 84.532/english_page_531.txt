rein in the midst of the tempest, sustaining
the Throne with one hand, & with the other
repelling the combined effort of the Parle-

noble & tranquil expression of reason & of
dignity in this same Edict, with
the pale flashes of this Apology,
which eloquence & talent have not

justifies you, & your own heart
absolves you. If the Magistrates who re-

eign to the tribunal of their conscience,
& to defend themselves only by invoking
the Laws, (a), it must be permitted at
least to the Magistrates who obey,
to invoke the same judge, & to
answer only by invoking their duty.

No, your glory does not depend
