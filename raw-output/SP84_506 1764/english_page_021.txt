Toulon the 24th September 1764.

                                    They are arming with haste
here, for the Escort of the Convoy in a Corps of
3000 Men, the frigate l'Atherière, commanded
by Mr. Fauchet, the Xebecs le Requin and le
Seulvant by Messieurs d'Espinouse, and
Guillaud, they will take 2 Months of Provisions;
the Departure is fixed for the 15th October.
   Many Cannons are arriving here,
but all so defective, that they will
not withstand the Test of the [Bout à
rame], which they refuse to have executed.
We have the Batteries of these Vessels
of 64, of some of 74, and of one of 80, and
of all that there is perhaps not Half
that is Good, it is the abuse of Attaching
to the Number of Vessels without giving
the destructible Pieces in our Armed
Ports; one does not think the admirable
[frenise]; one would not think the admirable
of the Court to support Mr. Maritz in
the supplies and Impositions.
   The Construction Timber arrives
slowly.                                Paris
