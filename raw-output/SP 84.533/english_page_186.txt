Paris the 26th September 1775.

Monsieur Brugnes has already
[tendu les lui dams] the arrangement of
the officers of the Navy which must be.
He has opened his new plan
of Administration, both for our
ports, and for the Eastern Colonies
and Western. The Count de Sully
Vice Admiral, he is named there, having of
the sea of Rolmes the Part, the affair
of the son of the King and [ou] the [assure Etres]
[soldée].

The affair of the King's Secretaries is
heated, the increase of 60 Millions
[grosses de Volumes d'augmens] of their
Charges, and within months will go or several
that the King [aüs] has made for the King;
which Monsieur Mailloux does.

The Parliament of Bordeaux is
entirely completed; that of
Toulouse is not yet
completely so, but that will not delay

Justice, and one will hold them as
if nothing had happened there.
