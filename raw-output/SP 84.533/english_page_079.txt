My Lord

     I have the Honour to send you en-
closed the Account of the draft of the Bills of Lading
from Madrid, for two Cargoes landed from the
Ships, amounting to £99.16. Sterling,
of which the half is £49.18. Sterling, which
Sum I pray His Lordship to order
to be made [Son Mrs] Mr William Davis
of the Treasury, by the next Post
[à Sa Cour de Poste], the Order of Messrs
William Davidson and Company.

I have the Honour to be with profound Respect

                    My Lord


                    Your very humble & very
                    obedient Servant
                         M. Willers


My Lord Suffolk.
