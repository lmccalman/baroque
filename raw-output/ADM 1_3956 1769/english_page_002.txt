Brussels                          Received the 13th of October 1703

Sir I have learned with much satisfaction from
the letter that you did me the honor of writing to me on the 4th
of this month that you had received the one that I wrote to you
on the 28th of last month. I am very glad that you were content
with the manner in which I gave account to Monsieur Rouillé
of what had passed concerning the post. I took the liberty
of sending him a copy of the letter that you had written to me
on this subject so that he might see by it how much you
had taken part in it, and that it might be easy for him to judge
the importance of this matter. I hope that he will have been
content with the conduct that I have maintained and with that which
you were kind enough to maintain on this occasion.

The Duke of Bavaria left here the day before yesterday to
go join the army that is on the Moselle.
It is believed that he will not remain long in that
quarter, and that he will very soon take up his
winter quarters. The weather has been very foul
for some days, which must greatly
inconvenience the troops that are in campaign.
