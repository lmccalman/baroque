abuses that will follow, by removing from the Magistrature the means to prevent them. It is an evil that reflection recommends to the skill, the national perspicacity, & to [cohacher] by a Law or its Ministers, of which I alone the Laws & their Minister have awaited the diverse unpunished [effais].

It has been a long time since despotism yielded in age. Each Order of the State has in turn experienced its murderous effects. But the Law of this convocation & seeking to shield it from the impunity of reclamations, arbitrary power finally dares to erect it into Law to remove forever all obstacles.

The derogations to the Laws, multiplied according to circumstances in the time of silence of [Bruxon], are the principle of such a strange resolution. The variations in forms, the creations, the suppressions of Commissions, the dispositions, the [nions] of procedures, the exiles, the imprisonments, the injunctions of silence, the extinctions of delay, the renewals of instructions, the cassations of sentences are as many acts that have been employed for a long time in recent years to deliver & incessantly seize from Justice accused persons & innocents. The last act, more violent than all the others, was the violation of the sacred deposit of a Registry by the removal of the procedures it contains.

Such were the preliminaries of the Edict. It is this execution of its system before publication. The instructions that it should have been promulgated to justify them. It unites in its views the duration of two times, antiquity which holds to the foundations that authorize it, & modern youth which prepares.

The fatal instant when the Law in the name of security would have alone the sentiment of right, & the object. Then the Parliament of Paris was going to assess the remedy to the violations of Laws by violence, & it would have deposited in its Registry; the Edict could not arrive in our Registers; it was therefore necessary to remove the subject from its Veto such that resulting in an application, it would have right to confer such violence. Article III tends to consecrate this

de facto, & with it all the others. The Edict does not limit itself to facts; it extends also to persons, & the contraventions & avoid it, & the violence remaining to be excused without reclamation, the King, in the Magistrature, to be cruel authorized, even in incriminating the Magistrature, who justifies the past & claiming uniformity & respect, authorizes to give to its reclamation the character of a punishable concert & still prescribes as a crime the regret of the arbitrary, to proscribe by these dispositions the zeal of judgments in the preamble of the Edict as contained & avowed principles the Dictionary & avowed & different [coulier] the Edicts in the [collegieux] monuments of our fathers, to confirm the virtues outside of our History. Behold a whole mystery of persecutions, of Laws, of fraud in do you recognize it under the sentiments of your Rights, Peoples!

between your Courts & your Peoples! What extent & what power must be able henceforth to Your legislations, & to Your Majesty the Princes of your Blood in 1717, there is no other Law that any would have determined would have defined before the fundamental publication of the State. It is on this holy & inviolable maxim & on these principles Defenders that France of indebted to François against all Charles VII, & that the House of Bourbon owes to. Crown. The acts of Kings which have by directly wound the fundamental Laws cannot subsist by the lack of power of the Legislator.
