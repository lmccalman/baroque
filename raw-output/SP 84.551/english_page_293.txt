there were Two or three Years ago, strong
Complaints, which one had not
foreseen, but the Prairies Being more
[argents], one returns to them today.
If the Platitudes recommence,
but uselessly this time,
what is most troublesome, is
that with the very good Authorized ones
the knowledge of these complaints,
that the Standards, I am content with them,
Judges and Parties, and that the Infant,
to whom one can have fear,
is lacking in strength, and too distant
and too impetuous for the Report
of similar ones.

The Parliament was very worried
before taking Vacations,
on the occasion of the list of [l'encifols]
increasing the Capitation of the
[Iles Dences] for [l'fros], but
it passed by the Plurality of
Votes.
