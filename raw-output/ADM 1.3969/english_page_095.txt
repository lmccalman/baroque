Paris the 19th May 1783.

The Marquis de Bouillé has just
arrived here, with M. de Coquy, [Préfet
portes] of Martinique, a few Days
after they had received the News
of the Signing of the Peace.

M. de la Mothe Piquet has been here
for eight months.

The King having ordered that all
Accounts in Material and in Expenditure
of the different Departments be
placed before his eyes, so that His Majesty
might examine them in his Council
of Finance, M. de Vergennes gave
his Own, there were 8 months [tout d'avis]
to begin with his own 1777.

The other Ministers or Secretaries
of State, are having theirs put
in order to present them in their turn.

The Troops that the King of Spain
is advancing on Navarre, Biscay
&c., are all foreign and are the
Italian, Swiss, and Irish brigades.
