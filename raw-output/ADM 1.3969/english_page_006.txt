Genoa, April 25, 1785.

The Vessel of which I spoke to you some
time ago, which was constructed in our Arsenal,
was sold to a Neapolitan Merchant,
who must make it depart at the first opportunity
for Naples.

In Venice they are constructing a large Bourgue,
and a Tartane.

In Marseille they are constructing a large Pingue,
and Two Tartanes.

At Longuette they are constructing a Pingue
of 5 to 4 Thousand Quintals, which they must
launch into the Water next Month; and there are
still Two others on the Shipyards.

At Vorigé they are constructing Two Pingues,
One Bourgue, and one Tartane, and several
other small Vessels.

The [chabeektière] that our Galleys captured
a few Months ago, was converted into a Galette,
to accompany the Galleys that must
go to Corsica. They are also working in
this Arsenal on the Construction of a 3rd
