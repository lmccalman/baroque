Toulon the 4th of April 1776

Mr. de Chabert,

Commanding the Atalante, received
yesterday Instructions for the Levant,
and set Sail this Morning to
go away.

The Evolution Squadron is entirely
in the Roadstead; The Sardines not having
arrived, the Pilgrims have been established there,
which are commanded by Mr. de
Latouche-Treville; [en Le suranne], and
will soon be fitted out.

Mr. Potin, who was to command
The Sardine, will fit her out in the Month
of June, to go to the Levant.
The same Staff that was to
be for The Sardine, will be for
The Péleiade.

I await here Mr. and Mrs.
de Charnes, and the 25th. They, lodging
at the Marquis de Miqueau's, Commander.
