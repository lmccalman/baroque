It is principally Catalonia
that by its industry and by its
application, and especially by its factories
does the most harm to all foreign
commerce, by the protection of the court
they have manufactured in a single year
in Barcelona and its environs, nearly
200 thousand pieces of twenty ells each
of printed fabrics, or calicos, whose
value amounts to 11 millions of reals
each year, and the value of white
fabrics to 30 millions ibid. But it is
for the most part rags that are
manufactured there, and that we are obliged to
buy very dearly, for want of other
foreign ones which are contraband.

Our bank continues its
course; it is absolutely master
of the exchange.

Work proceeds on the preparations for the
wedding of our Infanta Charlotte with
the Infante of Portugal.
