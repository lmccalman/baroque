Six


the bad state of health which his weeks-
sique has thrown me into has obliged me to
ask to Sir John Ligonier to move his Royal
Highness for leave for me to return, as I found that
health would not permit me to fulfil the other
company general with that activity which is
very fit & thought then it was incumbent upon me

                                                                to

Prince Stone Esqr                                             143
