Brest the 22nd May 1773.

     I have the honor to tell Mr
de Courcy disarmed, two are being armed,
wood Masts, to transport the
new Governor to Guadeloupe.
     There is an order from the Court to take them
from the list of clean Vessels. As to why.
The Commanders
of the Store ships have been changed.
     We are told of Less, they
threaten to remove one of the 40. from our
Salaries; Mr de Boynes is
strongly opposed to it, one must hope
that he will prevail. Until now
this Minister has done only good:
he has written only very
Satisfactory letters.
