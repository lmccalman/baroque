The King at the Solicitation of Madame Louise
has permitted the Celebrated Pope de Neuville to come
to reside at St Germain, but on Condition
that he would have his Sermons printed.

It was reported here, that on the 27th of last month the Queen
of Naples being on a small Bench at the Edge
of the Sea between the two [Mafleurs] de Reunito
in the Two [Gifts], and suddenly swept into the
Sea, dragged Her Majesty into it, who in turn
dragged the other Mr. de Reunito into it; but
Sailors who rushed forth pulled all three of them out
fortunately and promptly, they got off with
only the Fright.
