on guard of the Publicke.—

I shall before I proceed any further crave 
your grace's orders upon this affair, which I have also
mentioned to the Duke of Newcastle.—

The Magistrates of Campverdoun have ta-
-ken vigourous measures against the eight sailors
of which I have had a knowledge but partly, and the
Bailliff of Campbeltown in whose Districts the ports or
pertinents (permitted?) take all possible means to hin-
-der the publication of Campbeltown which is figut
celler Papers, is very strong and will I hope prevent
further mischief.—

The Deputies that were sent to prosecute
returns last wednesday my lord and have thereby
things very quiet there: there are meetings in these
Townes, Holland which nothing but a corps of My
story will suppress without is resolved att that lim
I have the honour to be with respectfully
my Lord Duke

your grace's
most humble and
obedient servant
