Toulon the 22nd January 1793.

We are still awaiting
favorable Winds for the Departure of our
two Fleets; the one from Brest must deliver to us
some of its Vessels; the sailors from Brest since
[quelqu'on] they have arrived, their Instructions
are such as are given in full Peace.

Work has proceeded vigorously to put
the Batteries of the Forts and of the Roadstead in
a State; as for the works
of the Arsenal, we have 36 Vessels
in a State to put to Sea, we have
also sailors? [unclear word], and some
[sont], it was necessary to beat to Arms for all
the Naval Army.

We have no Movements at
present, except our two Brigades.

Sailors have been put in the Uniform
of English France, with its transport
Vessels, loaded with troops.

The Provisions have traveled to Tunis every
two months, to sell the men.

The Pirates of the Archipelago have burned
a French Vessel, and massacred
the Crew of another, near
Sardinia.
