Second

Madrid the 19th September 1776.

From Cadiz they inform me,
that they were expecting there from said Ferrol thirteen
Ships, and 4 Galleys, to
augment the Squadron of the Marquis
of Casa Tilly, destined for the Expedition
of Mt de Bouvellos, [C'fieltes a lien)]
& to which they will send with
the convoy of Mercurthe all the funds
that this General will judge Necessary
that all is destined for Buenos Ayres,
which time will tell us:

Other Letters from Cadix, & from
S. Lucar, that I have seen, report,
that an American Frigate
has just engaged in a very lively Combat,
at the Height of Cape St Vincent,
with an English Frigate
which had three Vessels of
the nation, loaded with [Guins] for
Colonne,
